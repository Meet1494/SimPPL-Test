2025-02-16 15:01:08,the naturalization of nationalism the lack of words and banal nationalism,"something ive somewhere mused earlier but was reminded of it due to this post 

nationalism originally meant the movement that saw national identity as something that ought to be the basis for the state for each nation there is one state and for each state theres a primary nation

it presupposes both the existence of states and the existence  and importance  of a consistent experience of a national identity

nowadays nationalism is more or less a negative term it is mainly understood as meaning people who are particularly nationalist typically in a way that sees to openly value their own nationality above others

yet nationalism is in truth extremely prevalent across almost the whole political spectrum and on every level in society people ask a foreignseeming person where they come from to learn their true nationality everyone must have a nationality associated with them in our recordkeeping systems rhetoric drawing from nationalism is prevalent among all parliamentary politics no matter the party we fight for the brighter future for americans a statement basically any american politician could put out

nationalism has become so internalized and so presupposed and so naturalized that there isnt even a word left to describe it

that to me is alarming and sad for that to change somehow it should be once again made obvious that chauvinist nationalism and this sort of hidden everyday unnamed nationalism are basically simply the same thing of different strengths

michael billig coined the term banal nationalism for this but i doubt thats a term thats going to see much use banal is also negative

instead what i think might be good would be to just commonly and often call this out as what it is  nationalism no tippytoeing if an argument or a rhetoric or a phrase is rooted in nationalist thinking or presupposes nation states we call it what it is  nationalism",tzaeru,Anarchism,10,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iqu06b/the_naturalization_of_nationalism_the_lack_of/

2025-02-16 04:00:54,anarchocommunism is not a real thing,"why do so many modern anarchists conflate anarchism with socialism marxism and communism historically anarchist thinkers like proudhon bakunin and kropotkin were opposed to marxism not aligned with it bakunin for example saw marxs dictatorship of the proletariat as just another form of authoritarianism that would inevitably lead to oppressionsomething history proved correct

the term anarchocommunism comes largely from kropotkin but when he and other 19thcentury thinkers used the word communism they were describing a hypothetical stateless societyone that had never existed after the russian revolution communism became a concrete realworld system associated with centralized authoritarian states like the soviet union so why are people still using the term anarchocommunism today when communism now represents state control and authoritarianism its completely contradictory to attach anarchisma philosophy of antiauthoritarianismto a term that has become synonymous with government control

the reality is that modern leftist and activist groups have coopted anarchism blending it into a vague trendy brand of anticapitalism that serves their own agenda they take the aesthetics of rebellion while injecting anarchism with socialist and marxist ideasideologies that are inherently dependent on centralized power and state control but true anarchism is diametrically opposed to socialism and marxism because those ideologies require a governing force whether its a state or a socalled peoples collective anyone claiming to be an anarchist while advocating for socialism or marxism is either deeply misinformed or deliberately misleading

as i said in the last writing south korea is a bad place for organizing as a libertarian socialist most of my compatriots think that socialism  communism  stalinism  north korea  dictatorship  totalitarianism and if you talk about organizing to implement socialism they would likely think of north korea ccp or khmer rouge

  
however ive thought of another way to work for libertarian socialism without organizing the idea was youtube since youtube is a wellknown platform for koreans i can introduce anarchism and libertarianism to koreans without having to organize with others

  
so i asked permission for a foreign youtuber and he gladly let me translate the video the outcome was this

so apart from bragging about my works now im gonna talk more seriously now after i uploaded my first video im planning on uploading about 10 videos for about 3 years after 3 years i take korean sat and go to college however turns out i have no clue on which documentary is good to introduce to koreans

  
the next work i have half a mind to do is translating this  this though i havent asked permission from vice actually if someone has financial loss due to my copyright violation the person would be a capitalist right however i think i would enjoy receiving advice from you so would you kindly introduce to me fruitful documentaries that can be used without copyright violation about

2025-02-15 04:41:33,cultural anthropologys place on the map to true democracy,"cultural anthropology in a nutshell human life occurs in group realities lived systems of concepts and practices meanings and activities that lay out the structures and contents of worlds of experience

the worlds of experience built out of meanings and practices that we occupy and enact include forms of agency and personhood general structures of intention and desire general conceptions of self and others and the social and physical terrain of everyday life

we are socialized into group realities with their particular systems of concepts and practices which we then produce and reproduce as we enact ourselves and live our everyday lives using the available symbolic and material resources

sociocultural realities group enactments of worlds of experience and practice are potentially and usually constituted with various forms of inequality and domination built in building inequality into daily life generally benefits the privileged by making it hard to see from the inside where the inequality may appear natural thus people can enact inequality as either privileged or subordinated as they enact everyday life without being fully aware of what they are doing  
  
anthropology raises but mostly avoids addressing too clearly the question of what we can do about the realities we live in does having a good higherorder theory of human reality language and power enable us to develop a better languagepractice that could facilitate the construction of better realities based not on power concentration but on democracy freedom time love or whatever other values groups of likeminded people decide are best for them at any given moment i dont see any good reason not to be optimistic to believe even as faith if necessary as it probably is that groups of humans acting in good will have the capacity  the freedom and the ability  to create much much better ways of living than weve got going now",Art-X-,Anarchism,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ipttxp/cultural_anthropologys_place_on_the_map_to_true/

the collapse of an anarchist revolution that had everything in its favor was a pivotal moment the durruti group identified key structural weaknesses and sought to address them to prevent similar failures in future anarchist movements

they followed apolitical theories to their logical conclusion and recognized a critical issue the absence of political decisionmaking structures necessary for the coordination necessary to sustain the revolution

in 1938 they proposed a program with a strategic adjustment to anarchism how influential have their insights and warnings been on contemporary 21stcentury anarchist thought in the west

our programme
revolutions cannot succeed without clear objectives and direction the july revolution demonstrated this shortcomingwhile the cnt had the strength it lacked a cohesive plan to channel revolutionary energy leaders were caught off guard and uncertain about how to proceed the result was hesitation at a moment when decisive action was essential ultimately leading to the revolutions loss

these critical junctures leave no room for uncertainty there must be a clear path forward we aim to address this gap ensuring that the lessons of july and may are never repeated

to this end we propose a strategic modification to anarchism the establishment of a revolutionary junta

the revolution requires organized bodies to oversee and defend it against hostile elements experience has shown that opposition will not simply fade awayit must be confronted while some anarchist comrades may have ideological concerns the reality of events demands that we take a firm stance

if we wish to avoid repeating past mistakes we must act decisively against forces that do not align with the interests of the working class

key proposals
1 establishment of a revolutionary junta or national defense council

this body will be formed through democratic elections within union organizations consideration will be given to those at the front ensuring their right to representation
the junta will not interfere in economic matters which remain under union control
functions of the junta include
coordinating defense and managing the war effort
maintaining revolutionary stability
handling international affairs
conducting revolutionary outreach
positions will rotate regularly to prevent entrenchment with trade union assemblies exercising oversight
2 economic power to the syndicates

since july unions have demonstrated their ability to manage economic production effectively their role must be fully recognized and elevated
an economic council aligned with industrial federations may be established to enhance coordination
3 free municipality

before foreign rule spain had a strong tradition of municipal autonomy this decentralized model must be revived to prevent the formation of a new state system
in the new society governance will be handled by local municipalities supported by unions since all members of society will be producers there will be no inherent conflicts of interest
municipalities will be organized into local regional and national federations maintaining strong ties with the unions at every level

today i was planning to join a group reading at a local anarchist collective unlucky an ice storm hit but mostly for finding community i suppose the point of this post is that im feeling anarchism or any other anticapitalist movement for that matter is a lost cause considering how dominant our economic and political structures are learning about the world only depresses me more so why should i feel anarchism will gain any wider engagement or at least enough to be effective after all if we did we would surely be warred against until we had no capacity to serve ourselves

i want to be hopeful maybe at the very least i will help a movement persist beyond my own life as ai progresses however it feels as if the rich who have exclusive control over its use will dictate the course of history just as before

2025-02-11 17:56:27,living a meaningful anarchist life vs privilege,"hi everyone  i hope this post finds you well and with some nourishment and loved ones bringing colour into your life  i wanted to inquire with this sub about some existential questions i am having regarding my own life path and i guess a request for some advice

i am a white settler 30m currently living in a city where ive been for the past 6 years  i was not born here but i have developed many good relationships here with people projects and the land  i spent my first 4 years here involved in activism and advocacy particularly regarding housing justice until i burned out and my energy output became unsustainable  since that time two years ago ive been struggling to reorient my life path towards meaningful longterm projects  the reality of rent food prices traffic congestion etc is of course fairly suffocating i have found my own ways to manage but systemically i dont have faith in things getting better

presently i have some good friends living in a rural area 2 hours from the city who would gladly welcome me into their community  most amenities are 1545 minutes away but there is plentiful access to land and good soil for farminggardening  i have access to an offgrid land project with dear friends where we could live ruggedly and supporting one another  there are many enticing things about this rural life the directness of growing my own food fetching my own water firewood building structures from scraps doing all of this with friends but i have some hangups  namely i feel that i would be cashing in on my whiteness and intergenerational wealth in a way that compromises my values ie prioritizing my own comfort over vulnerable strangers inevitably dedicating a higher proportion time amp energy to offgrid chores driving etc  of course there would be the possibility of developing more relationships with locals and creating mutual aid projects  and even though it is a very white region there are historic black and indigenous communities 3040 minutes away that i could develop more of a relationship with ultimately im struggling to shake the idea that the city is where i should be because of its density of important frontlines of social struggle and i also really enjoy its internationalist nature density of young people sometimes nightlife

perhaps my internal conflict of anarchism in the city vs the country is unnecessarily dualistic yet it feels true that they are very different lifestyles   with the reduced stress of living rurally rentfree baby i would enjoy dedicating more time to writing researching and possibly even publishing anarchist histories  other than that i dont exactly have a skilled trade but i have made myself handy for carpentry amp construction jobs in the past

2025-02-11 15:14:27,neurodivergent disabled care leaver and youth anarchist trapped in academia an italian educational odyssey,"tldr i need formal education and credentials to survive and eventually reformoverthrow the system but i deeply oppose its reductionist oppressive and antineurodivergent approach i want libertarian education that embraces doubt critical thinking and diverse ways of knowing currently trapped between institutional survival and my anarchist epistemology looking for perspectives on navigating this contradiction without losing myself in the process

ive been doing exhausting research and reading several posts about education in this subreddit

im new here and im mainly looking for likeminded people who are so rare to meet in italy

ive always been an unorthodox student i live in italy im autistic and gifted and i live with a chronic disabling condition i have no family my autistic condition has made me particularly devoted to science and over the years my reflections and way of thinking have naturally drawn me closer to anarchist thought particularly its ecological and communitarian current perhaps im more anarchist than i realize

throughout my life journey i have experienced systematic discrimination and abuse istitutional too at university in high school and in the communities where i lived as a minor my unconventional way of thinking giftedness political practices and specific needs related to my atypicality were certainly catalyzing elements of these experiences of marginalization and violence these continuous social pressure and discrimination have led me to develop deep depression

i consider anarchism as a possible foundation for an ethical epistemological paradigm that aspires to overcome fragmented reductionist knowledge my passion for study and reading which i experience as acts of subversion has progressively distanced me from contemporary institutions in ten years of professional experience across public private cooperatives and ngos i have observed how neoliberal ideology and kyriarchy have corrupted ideals principles and projects at every level especially in italy

currently i do a job i love  i dedicate myself besides obsessive studying to advocacy and support for young people who grew up without families  but its economically undervalued i live in poverty in our country which i deeply love for its language food climate and geography working conditions for neurodivergent and disabled people are extremely problematic i also strongly oppose english as a lingua franca im sorry for nativeenglish both for sociopolitical reasons and due to my neurodivergent needs therefore leaving italy is not the most immediate option for me

ive enrolled in university to continue my studies but im increasingly convinced that mass education pursues objectives far from learning quality and the development of critical thinking and autonomy  fundamental elements for forming individuals capable of contributing to their own their community and natures wellbeing the degree appears increasingly necessary but the meritocratic competition for scholarships combined with the selfreferential nature of the italian system requires conforming ones cognitive processes to a pathological system and assimilating beliefs that dont belong to me the elimination of doubt in institutions evidently considered subversive is another significant issue

my purpose is to conduct research in the sociology of institutionalized knowledge and in epistemic justic to overturn my countrys educational system i strongly believe that the way to an antioppressive and equitable society parts of education however to gain acknowledgment credentials and economic support just enough to survive haha i must follow the institutional path

friend so if youre an anarchist then you should like what trump and musk are doing right now

me well no

friend but if they are trying to break down all of these various government programs and remove regulations and restrictions isnt this in line with your worldview as an anarchist

me no and let me explain first not every anarchist would agree with me but i would hope most would second trump and musk are not tearing down the government completely they are tearing down the things standing in the way of their ability to amass more power and more money third anarchy is not a topdown process without the bottom up approach where communities are built upon mutual trust and mutual aid the swift removal of parts of the us government can only lead to greater chaos with the bottom up approach communities learn to work together in mutually beneficial ways cooperating for the benefit of all and removing their reliance on corporations and governments governments would dissolve because there is no need for them corporations would dissolve because they would be replaced by individuals cooperating for the benefit of all anarchism despite popular belief is not synonymous with chaos and what trump and musk are doing is simply causing chaos for the sake of a fascist power grab

2025-02-09 19:06:47,is fascism still a relevant category for political analysis today,"hi everyone id like to start a discussion about the use of the term fascism and whether it remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective

in many political debates today especially within antifascist circles the term fascism is frequently used to describe authoritarian rightwing projects and figures such as trump bolsonaro or elon musk however i wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if on the contrary it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding

personally i believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant however labeling figures like musk or trump as fascist seems problematic to me even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements applying this label often turns them into mere hollywood villains making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique additionally this broad use of fascism may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of todays political and economic landscape such as corporate capitalism or technofeudalism

authors like murray bookchin peter gelderloos and noam chomsky have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term fascism arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading instead they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism colonialism and broader hierarchical systems edit i originally made a mistake regarding chomsky in fact he does use the term fascism quite broadly thanks to a response from dvdanarchist on this post i can now clarify this

some questions id like to explore

 to what extent does fascism in its historical sense mussolini hitler etc remain a valid category for understanding todays authoritarianism
 does the overuse of fascism reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context
 from an anarchist perspective is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as fascist
 what do you think of the critiques from bookchin gelderloos and chomsky on this topic are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue

id love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject thanks",Aleor_28,Anarchism,69,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ilmd11/is_fascism_still_a_relevant_category_for/

2025-02-09 01:18:54,3 reasons privacy is worth taking back,"despair is just the long way to apathy

thats one of the biggest tricks that centers of power use to silence dissent and stop any action against them deny that a problem exists until its so obvious and so bad that nobody can ignore it and then say theres nothing we can do at this point so why bother weve seen this happen with capitalism and the recordbreaking difference between the rich and poor weve seen it with climate change and weve seen it with the loss of our privacy right now  especially in the us  it seems like theres more interest in internet privacy than theres been in a long time but when people look into it and find out how far we are from being truly private they get discouraged were being pulled in 2 different directions we cant really do anything and we cant just do nothing

if thats how you feel youre not alone but your privacy is definitely still worth taking back

1 surveillance isnt free

corporations and governments have a lot of money energy and computing power to track people but its not infinite the most intensive types of surveillance the ones that involve dedicated experts complex deanonymization techniques and things like that are mostly saved for highlevel targets like terrorists and military agents the basic level of surveillance they do on everyone is all passive automatically logging information about you as you live your life

anything you do to separate yourself from their trackers stops a little of that doing something as simple as switching your browser to a more private one or disabling location or google apps on your phone or deleting apps you dont need and logging out of social media means 1 less source of information about your life that can be tracked

are more serious measures worth learning and doing absolutely because privacy is freedom the more dissenting threatening to power or targeted you are the more private you need to be but its not allornothing and you can get better at it over time

especially because of the second reason

2 information goes out of date

its a common belief that once your information is out there theres no use protecting it but almost everything about you changes over time so if someone stops being able to track you eventually what they know about you will be less useful maybe you dont go to the same places or talk to the same people as you used to maybe your beliefs and opinions changed maybe you have a different job a different computer or phone a different bank account or card than you did before for all they know maybe you changed your name and moved out of the country each piece of information you keep someone from getting is information that might not be true anymore

one big exception is your dna which is why everyone should stay away from things like 23andme and ancestry

3 privacy is a community effort

staying private would be impossible if you were the only one doing it if everyone is leaving their data out in the open and youre the only one keeping it secret youll stand out more than anyone else  but if everyone is securing their privacy its there for people who need it most and secure messages group chats and file sharing are only secure if everyone keeps that information safe

plus privacy is only accessible because of opensource projects and the people who develop them almost always for free as well as those who learn privacy and security so they can help each other with it without that only the best security experts could keep their data private

and in a worstcase scenario if everything goes wrong and they catch you doing something that really pisses them off theres nothing like people you can trust around you who will have your back and not snitch on you and will remember you and visit you in jail if it comes to that

the ultimate point of surveillance is fear because without fear its hard to control someone

2025-02-07 18:42:07,how could an anarchist get into politics,"much of anarchism as a social movement revolves around nongovernmental mutual aid and other nonpolitical support organizations but if any given anarchist sought to enter government with the intention to bring about at least some minor change how would they go about that

at least for me who does not like labels but would best be defined as an individualist anarchist  in which anarchism is a way of life that i personally hold myself to  i do not engage in the civic aspects of government ie i do not vote because i believe it to be amoral i am often critical of the possibility of actually effecting any real change through government because it is the enemy after all but i have considered after law school i start next autumn pursuing politics with the idea of at least keeping other politicians in check lol but do not know how this would even work

1 would an anarchist openly declare themselves as such putting themselves at odds with the status quo and likely reducing the odds of being elected

2 would an anarchist be better served by playing the game with an intent to reach higher offices in hopes of bringing about change more effectively

3 or would an anarchist just best be served by staying out of politics and just focusing on what they can do personally to bring about social change

see the usual workaround to the liberal propaganda in recent years was independent journalism or just direct information on platforms like twitter tiktok instagram sorta and other online platforms or relying on google algorithms to promote their websites the issue now is that those platforms have basically decided to censor everything that doesnt suck on fascist cock so nobody is able to get their usual news from crowdsources or whatever people are actually listening to local news and national news with fresh ears and finding it to be distasteful

there is a demand in the general public for honest truthful news about shit and they arent getting it online they arent getting it in their current newspapers either anarchists have done much work to get their message out but censorship and state repression of our ideas has blocked the reach of our ideas for many years i propose a solution

i recently had a conversation with some woman probably 2030 yrs older than me about migration and we were concerned about situation of educated syrian people that they might be deported back to syria 

and i said that im my country is similar with other migrants like people from afganistan and more and that they application for international protection in ue massively was getting rejected in past few months

and she said that its a different situation because those syrian people were highly educated  and those from afganistan arent 

and i was like ok and so to deserve living you have to have proper documents profession or otherwise your live doesnt matter

but i didnt say that and instead recommended her some book about migration issues written by my fav author i didnt knew what to say

and idk i might be wrong but in my opinion she said a very cruel thing why does it matter if you have a degree or not when it comes to deportation people are something more than just useful moneymachine",blue_cherrypie,Anarchism,30,124,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iidvfi/not_understanding_other_nonanarchists_when_it/

hey everyone

ive been ideologically anarchist for a decade i havent engaged in much meaningful direct action mostly just participated in a couple local protest movements alongside liberals

unfortunately i found my way to anarchism through reading and contemplation not through a community i had no concept of security at first there was nobody to warn me that the state will not respect my freedom of thought and speech so ive been posting about my politics on my personal social media accounts for years now

i only recently began taking the idea of privacy and security more seriously my concern is that if i ever were to get involved in the anarchist community id be a risk to everybody

it would be super easy for the police to connect my radical views to my legal name and to people i know im a walking security hazard

so what if anything can i do to mitigate this hazard does it actually work to delete my accounts or will all that information still exist somewhere out there

or should i resign myself to keeping my distance from any radical activity for life",Aggressive-Tale6363,Anarchism,31,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ii2mc2/am_i_a_lost_cause/

i dont mean for the above to sound condescending   instead a genuine plea that if you feel involved please consider your stance weve long fought the rise of this becoming many groups formed in unison yet they still inflate themselves with nonexisting power desecrating all voices unaligned whether it be as a whisper or a gaggle the organizing took place when your core values either aligned with or urged against this chauvinistic bullshit throughout the eras the fight has taken place strategizing is the only way well overcome this

its as though weve become so desensitized to headlines bold with unprecedented that were now ready to die for change dont allow martyr to become hot press regardless of what radicalized you do not effortlessly let radicalization become the end of you that fight you felt is survival for all how quickly well be eradicated charging forward prepared to die if needed no prepare to stand your ground at all costs those costs being any means to protect and persevere ironically we are the heritage foundation we are in need of protecting history arts architecture science theologies and literature enforcing the removal of false narratives and the rhetoric whitewashing of it all return culture and protect those indigenous to the practices understand economics and political science but refuse contributions of that knowledge to the undeserving make an example of how infrastructure does not equate to industrialism nor capitalism prove that this is all possible while prioritizing humanity

this thought became urgent to share when topics regarding 25 protests became largescale some of the more linear thought processes ive witnessed debate whether it is a trap or not the argument being that it doesnt matter solidarity is key i completely agree that solidarity is key and should be the fundamental you can protest in solidarity many ways before you stand in front of your capital

2025-02-03 23:02:59,safety tips for protests,"with the tension rising in pretty much anywhere and having seen some threads in here about protests i thought we could do a little thread about safety tips for protests ill start by contributing what i know and what i lived and everyone can add stuff from their own experiences maybe well disagree on some points but its all for giving advices to people to make sure they stay safe note also any advices here not encouraging anyone to talk about illegal stuff online because those advices are about safety and talking about illegal stuff online definitely isnt safe

im not the guy with the most experience doing radical stuff during protest but ill still share what i have its mostly about what to do if you dont want to get arrested and mostly rely on being able to avoid getting stuck in complicated situations in the first place

1  
in 2012 student strike in qubec i was arrested not following a protest but 3 months after it because our local police had nothing else to do small rural city and they wanted to file who were among the students of that specific protest in which we had blocked an exit from a public park after the prime minister came there i wasnt even among the most radical people there at the time i was just standing next to them and cops happened to take my picture its part of what radicalized me really i had only stopped a guy from falling because he had been shoved by the police and i myself tried to avoid contact with police as much as possible

gtso yeah avoid getting close to the police because even if they dont touch you even if youre not doing anything specifically illegal they can find ways to arrest you if they want be aware of any officer further back who might be filming or taking pictures if you spot them and dont want to be arrested move away from the hot spots

2

in 2015 i went to a protest in montreal it was taking place just after the anarchist bookfair and was part of the wave of student protest against austerity measures i was at the anarchist bookstore and saw around 50 people marching so i just joined them i had shirts in my bag and ski goggles just in case  
they went to up to a street i dont remember which i dont know montreal enough it was a pedestrian street for the summer but the cops suddenly drove in with minivans just a bit faster than the retreating protesters were running when the protesters where moving to the sides the minivan stopped cops in riot gear got out of the minivans and grabbed the students that just got out of the vans path i had already moved to the sides as soon as the vans had showed up there were not enough people to go and take them back

gt dont stay in the streets if the protest cant hold it anymore when you dont have the critical mass anymore move to the sides and keep your distance  you can only hold a spot against the police if there are many many more of you than there are of them and you still need good protective equipment to do so and it wont last forever

3

a bit later during the same protest i followed a group of cgep students to the front of their college someone came and said that many of their friends were stuck in a kettle and they wanted to do something about it i didnt want my picture taken again so i used the shirts and ski google to become part of the blackbloc

but while i was following the group we came to an intersection the street to the left was flanked by cops so i stayed on the right side of the group seeing that all the people i was with were turning left between two rows of cops i tried to say something but quickly just left the protest and hid behind some brick pillar in front of a commerce entrance when looking at the street the cops had wheeled behind the small group i was with they were now being kettled i turned around the city block a while found another protester that had been separated we left the spot and i had them check out while i was finding an isolated spot to remove my black shirts and goggles

under my tshirt i had a white xviiith century style shirt and coat whose sleeves i had rolled up under the tshirt the person i was with told be you dont look like a protester that was the point

gtlearn to recognize the signs of a kettle have disposable clothes if you want to conceal your identity avoid profiling by not looking like someone who would go to protests  i know that last one is entirely dependant on privilege but do your best

4

a few months earlier we had taken part in a protest in winter in my rural homecity i had a big red and black flag i was masked but my clothes were very noticeable me and my friend of the time did the protest nothing illegal but we still slowed traffic which is such a crime in the eyes of rural people coming back from the protest we waited at our university after a little while we left passed through a little wood to my appartment but in the street of my appartment we got stopped by police who questionned us illegally asked us for our names and adress saying that if we didnt comply we would be arrested of course they wanted our names so they would have files on the local protestors because were a small city and there are not a lot of us out there

gtthis is the counterexample to the last trick a mask wont save you if your clothes are still recognizable and if you dont throw away your disguise in a spot that wont be seen also scout ahead even  or should i say  especially after the protest protests ends but there are cops working around the clock and if they want to harass protestors they can just wait for the protest to end and target people when they go back home isolated and vulnerable

5  
in 2017 there were protests organized by racist group la meute wolfpack in qubec city a bunch of reactionnary protesting against immigration it was around the end of november iirc there was a counterprotest organized by different leftwing organizations at the same time  
i went there with a few friends from my small city a 2 hour car ride away

i was dressed with a good looking coat something someone professional would wear i walked here and there to try and scout things a bit i went all the way up to the rightwing protest and then came back down to our counterprotest when i arrived there was already a police line pushing on counterprotestors many of which had white traces of maalox in their face to treat the pepper spray i was behind the police line they were on my right i walked up to the foot of the qubec wall near the parliament

i turned right in the little park that was empty and went back toward the parliament and the counterprotestors a bit further back a new police line was forming flanking the more peaceful parts of the protest  
i feigned innocence and asked the police to pass they allowed me to do so  
i went back into the protest and warned people that a kettle was forming up many more liberal counterprotestors told me that it wouldnt happen there  
i found the people i came to qubec with and told them it was time to leave

the kettle was forming up near the parliament there is a medievallike wall in qubec with a big door for the cars to pass through and smaller doors on the sidewalks a policeman with a dog was standing there we were far enough from the rest of the protest that we didnt look like part of it  
a policeman on the wall told another one that we could go through the one with the dog said we couldnt so i told him sorry sir but your colleague on the wall told us to go can we know which one we must listen to first he told us okay you can go  
we went and reunited with other people of our region in a small cafe waited an hour and then left qubec city

we learned later that a few of our friends from montreal and one of our guy from our city were arrested a bit further away they were still forming a black bloc

gtonce again if you dont have the critical mass leave if you see cops forming new lines on the sides of a protest leave be able to become unnoticeable blend yourself in the crowd of ordinary people just walking by people will say to stay in group  
this is only good when standing your ground and this can only be done if youre in numerical superiority  
sooner or later the protest will scatter and cops will start targeting those smaller groups going home or the protest will just be kettled

you need to know when its starting to happen to be able to scatter and leave just before that id even recommend people who decide to organize protests to adopt a guerilla style of protests do the protests with ordinarylooking people scouting ahead at the first sign of cops signal scatter and reconvene at another point",Emergency_Okra_2466,Anarchism,3,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ih2uxm/safety_tips_for_protests/

2025-02-03 21:59:30,why arent you salting 25,"all ive seen are statements about how this is a trap but if people are showing up shouldnt we be as well if we refuse who fills the gap what happens when the authcomms show up instead you can say it doesnt matter but history says otherwise occupy started as an anarchist movement and still got stolen why because anarchists were there first but didnt hold the ground

if anarchists arent showing up who are we leaving this to the same tankie organizers who will happily coopt any movement that lacks a strong antistate presence the reformists who will pacify it into a series of symbolic gestures before declaring victory and going home the state itself which will push its own narrative in the absence of strong resistance

i dont buy the argument that this is some perfect trap that can only result in failure of course the state responds to uprisings with repressionthats how it works but if people are out in the streets being radicalized by the violence of the system thats precisely where anarchists should be if were not then others will shape the narrative weve seen it happen before

so where is the strategy why arent we salting this

salting  when union organizers get jobs at nonunion workplaces to organize from within it works for labor so why arent we doing it for protest movements instead of armchair commentary why arent anarchists embedding themselves in these spaces to help push things further keep them from getting coopted and actually make use of the energy thats already there

if im wrong lets talk about it i dont mind being challengedim on edge maybe not thinking clearly but i dont feel hazy just frustrated

they dragged him out in handcuffs 

this happened 8 days ago his lawyer has been in contact with our general manager since then but we really have no information on his situation beyond which detention center theyre holding him in

this never shouldve fucking happened im pretty sure they didnt even have a warrant so while i understand my floor manager was wellintentioned and was trying to cover for my coworker he really shouldve just immediately told them to fuck off 

i figured itd be a good idea to put up some know your rights posters specifically that are aimed at knowing your rights in the workplace and how to protect your coworkers when ice shows up most of the kyr posters ive found online are focused on knowing your rights at home  on the street any links to good kyr posters are appreciated im looking for english and spanish versions also i might just make my own so recommendations on what info to include also helps for context i work at a restaurant in massachusetts

2025-02-03 16:37:07,witholding as a form of protest,"i was wondering what ways could really get back at the top 1 whithout causing much harm to those involved i think its easy to call for mass general strikes but that takes a lot of planning and people would experience real harm by being out of work for what would likely need to be a multiple week strike 

  
my proposal is this any left leaning person who has a mortgage should simply stop paying it 

  
thats the elevator pitch but more realistically the sudden loss of thousands of mortgage payments would cripple these banks and its something that can be sustained for multiple months by the witholder month 1 you save x amount of dollars by month 2 theyll start making calls etc now you have 2x cash in your savings maybe by month 3 theyll start making motions like theyll go to court maybe send a demand letter it will be different in each state but all in all across each of the states youll likely have 36 months of being able to save up your mortgage payment before they even get the courts involved 

  
now here we are at month 6 this has become a movement 1000 people per state could be enough but obviously more is better banks are really feeling the pain of not having the cash and now you all are sitting on 6 months of mortgage that you can keep as cash or likely will use it to help with any varrying emergencies that will spring up in the next few months of the regime they start moving to foreclose on these homes depending on your state you could be looking at an additional 6 months to upto and beyone 24 months especially since well now be clogging the already strained court system with all of these foreclosure cases most firms handling foreclosure have lowered staffing levels since the 20082012 us mortgage crisis it would likely take them 12 years to fire back up to 2010 levels to now match the demand to even file the cases 

so they blink then hey no harm no foul youve got the 6 months in the bank you can just bring everything current and weve had our demands met if they dont then as you can see likely anyone who is fortunate to be in this situation would likely have 12 years to be able to weather this storm so it would likely be the banks that crumble first only took about 2 weeks of witheld labor during the pandemic to realize that could make them cow

2025-02-03 16:31:14,we need more leftwing propaganda,"this is something ive been mulling over since the 2024 us election for years the farright has been backed by massive thinktanks like prager university and the daily wire spewing propaganda and fear that has shaped the narratives of the political right often putting trans people square in the crosshairs alongside illegals as an easy outgroup to represent the degeneration of society

  
the right has formed a cult of personality around trump swallowing wholesale the red scare propaganda over the communist democrats all while the democrats gleefully skip behind them trying to imitate them and pleasing absolutely no one i only advocate for participating in capitalist democracy to keep the worst reactionaries out of power as its foolish to think the democrats will stand up for anyone but the capitalist class



but as weve seen when the democrats fail to commit to standing up for human rights giving wishywashy noneanswers like ill follow the law people stay home and when people stay home the maga cult flocks out in droves to make their idolatrine the law of the land further erasing human rights and enforcing christian nationalist brand fascism

  
this brings me to my point about anarchism the simple truth of the matter is that we need more propaganda more art more literature to drag this world kicking and screaming toward a better future already mega entertainment corps like disney are erasing overt trans representation in media to please their bigoted shareholders walking back on the bare minimum token representation they already had

  
we cannot let the farright control the conversation any more than they already have weve seen what happens when our socalled leaders refuse to offer any sufficient counter to these narratives stuck in an endless loop of we go low you go high we are watching in real time as the right uses culture war narratives to justify human rights atrocities and since the democrats are too preocupied with playing by the rules no matter how much the other side stacks the deck we need to cut through the bullshit with our own propaganda in conjunction with direct communitybased action to protect the lives of lgbtq people and other targeted minorities

  
every piece of art we make helps to further cement our place in culture even when the state tries to censor us society is nothing without the individual actions of people collectively working to protect the persecuted so even if all you can do is pick up a pencil or type in a word document we need you to do it and we need to bolster those who do just as much as those directly acting to protect the most vulnerable amongst us

and what im really wishing would happen instead of afm is a neighborhood assembly where we can meet each other and talk about what to do if we see ice

the thing is i just moved to this neighborhood a month ago i dont know many people i havent even hung out with the other three people in my building yet though i have their numbers thats why im not just like im gonna go talk to x y and z and well start organizing the assembly

im just gonna start talking to people about the idea cuz so far no one else is doing it and it clearly needs to get done you dont have to be an anarchist to realize that

my plan is to try to find nexus points in the neighborhood  people who are connected to a lot of other people like bartenders is my first thought cafe and restaurant workers salon workers im white so i should probably prioritize anywhere with poc workers

i think itll be a pretty easy sell people are really scared and the best way to deal with fear i think is to prepare and get people to know each other people want something like this even if they dont know it yet

once i get a few key people on board i think it could pick up steam really quickly

2025-02-02 15:35:45,why do i get the feeling that all of this sort of started with either 911 or with the 2008 financial crisis,"so i remembered something that someone said during brexit which was that people needed to stop listening to the experts and this was because the experts were saying stuff before 2008 and then the financial crisis hit and then people stopped trusting the experts and im wondering if that cascaded into a deep mistrust of certain institutions and the government and things like that it happened in the uk but im also wondering if it happened in the us the rise of the internet was happening around that time too so while many people may be blaming the internet and while the internet may be of contributing factor im wondering how much things like 911 and the 2008 financial crisis also played a part and i took a look at the trustworthiness level the american people trusted the government over a period of time and i saw that there was a rise around around 911 and then it just went down and it seemed like it never really recovered 



and as you probably know things like recessions and financial instability create an opportunity for the rides in the far right

im just interested in your thoughts on this as well as wondering why people started distrusting around 911 because i thought that people would have been really excited about that because it was such gungho patriotism and nationalism and i thought people would have been very trusting of the government at the time but it seems like it almost immediately went down after the attack rather than going up first and then going down which is what i would have expected more",Arktikos02,Anarchism,38,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ifzsj2/why_do_i_get_the_feeling_that_all_of_this_sort_of/

2025-02-02 11:51:41,practicing what you preach and working in government systems,"ive been thinking about the idea of anarchists working within government systems some argue that this is a way to practice what they preach but i see a contradiction thats worth addressing

anarchy at its core is about rejecting hierarchical control state authority and the structures that uphold oppression governments exist to maintain power over people and their systems are designed to sustain themselves not to be dismantled from within so when someone claims to be an anarchist while actively working in government it raises an important question are they truly practicing anarchist ideals or are they just participating in the very system they claim to oppose

now i understand that survival under capitalism requires compromise many of us take jobs within systems we dont fully align with because we need to pay bills get healthcare or navigate the reality we were born into theres no shame in that but lets be honest theres a difference between working a job to survive and working for the government while claiming to resist it

if your paycheck comes from an institution built on oppression youre reinforcing that institutions existence whether intentionally or not you can believe youre making a difference but real systemic change doesnt come from within systems designed to preserve themselves governments dont allow people to hold real power unless it serves their function thats why historically even wellintended reformists end up constrained by the structures they work within

with the growing threats were facing environmental collapse increased surveillance rising authoritarianism we dont need more people trying to fix a system that was never meant to serve us we need more people turning their backs on it entirely saying no more to oppressive laws exploitative labor and a system that actively works against us we spend so much of our time energy and resources feeding a machine that is trying to kill us imagine what could happen if that energy was redirected into something better

im not telling people what to do everyone has to make their own choices but personally i believe the future isnt in reforming or working within the system its in walking away from it in creating something new something prosperous something that actually serves us a world where we invest in each other not in a dying system that was built to control us

we all exist within oppressive systems but how we engage with them matters the question isnt just what we do but why and whether our choices are truly moving us toward liberation or just making it easier to exist within the system as it is",EndColonization,Anarchism,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ifvn8n/practicing_what_you_preach_and_working_in/

she took it out the front door and released the snake not ten feet from the door in some misguided catchandrelease nonsense the snake rushed toward me and i woke up screamingmy therapist thinks the mom in this dream was my perception of the dnc and oppositional establishment in the us i agree i am a politically disenfranchised person and only have one vote i rely on broader civil society to protect me from discrimination and harm they seem to have failed me latelymy real mom just spoke to me today she shared a dream she had on wednesday she dreamed of a giant trump head in a maga hat attached to the body of a giant snake looming over her in darkness at her side was a female family member maybe me maybe her sister or my sister my mom shouted grab a pole and together she and the other woman started bashing the snake  
  
my mom said she saw the faces cheeks puff up and distort and then she realized thats where she had to strike she smashed through it with the pole describing it to me on the phone as that grisly resistance feeling you get when you cut through an animal i love my mother then the snake dissolved  
  
we then talked about meaningful action and how the destruction of this evil has to come not from our american left but the world because if it comes from only us they will continue to denounce and deflect and lie and claim conspiracy  
  
this is a global threat and i love my mom and i know she a woman of influence and consequence is connected with men women laborers and policy makers here in washington who all despise this administration and are committed to real action

2025-02-01 00:16:29,anarchism propaganda  rulebreaking,"i think this technically fits here this is a small portion on the complex field hypersanity that pertains to the ideals of anarchism

if it doesnt fit please lemme know why as im still learning about anarchism in comparison  
i did this last year when i had more time to learnresearch

think of hypersanity as a framework for perspectives using consequential mechanics for outcomes this isnt about inherent ethical frameworks  theres many ways it can be applied in practice just like criticalthinking isnt inherently goodbad depends on how its used



if rules were never broken thered never be growth or evolution the secret in life that noone will tell you is  which ones to break and when

in a world where conformity often feels like the safest path rulebreaking is frequently viewed with suspicion however through the lens of hypersanity rulebreaking emerges not as a reckless endeavor but as an essential catalyst for growth and transformation both on a personal and societal level this perspective asks us to rethink not just the necessity of rules but the very nature of why they exist and how they shape our experiences

the reality is that not all rules are designed to nurture or protect many are relics of past circumstances established in times that required stability or control they may have been created by individuals who sought to maintain power or simply to preserve a tradition without questioning its presentday utility growth then requires the discernment to differentiate between those rules that foster development and those that impede progress it calls for the courage to break those rules that have outlived their relevance and now serve as barriers rather than bridges

rulebreaking therefore becomes an act of liberation it is a means of freeing ourselves from outdated paradigms that hinder progress enabling us to step into new realities where personal and collective growth can thrive the journey of questioning challenging and ultimately breaking certain rules is what allows society to evolve this evolution is not about discarding all structures but about understanding which structures still serve us and which ones need transformation rulebreaking when approached with wisdom and responsibility is an exercise in conscious evolutionan act that honors the potential for positive change

intelligent rulebreaking courage and discernment

hypersanity involves a deeper insighta profound awareness that surpasses conventional definitions of sanity in this state one discerns which rules require breaking for growth it is not about rebellion for rebellions sake it is about intentional action driven by clarity and guided by a responsibility towards both oneself and society intelligent rulebreaking is thus an act of courage that comes with understanding the deeper purposes these rules serve or fail to serve

consider scientific paradigms throughout history some of the most groundbreaking scientific advancements have come from breaking away from established norms newtons laws once provided a comprehensive view of the physical world but einstein dared to question and expand upon them ultimately reframing our understanding of physics this type of rulebreaking wasnt rooted in a desire to dismantle the old but rather to grow beyond its limitations to find deeper truths that served humanitys evolving understanding of the universe

einsteins work is a perfect example of how rulebreaking when approached intelligently leads to expansion it required not only technical knowledge but also a deep awareness of where the existing framework fell short breaking away from newtonian physics was not an act of destruction but one of creationushering in new possibilities for how we perceive time space and gravity it demonstrates that the true essence of intelligent rulebreaking lies in understanding where the old models limit us and how new models can bring a more accurate and complete understanding of reality

similarly social norms and justice have seen profound shifts because individuals or movements challenged entrenched beliefs the progress in civil rights gender equality and environmental protection has often come from a willingness to disregard the outdated norms that perpetuated injustice it was not reckless rebellion but an intentional choice rooted in empathy and a vision for a more inclusive society the courage to break these social rules is what drives meaningful transformationit paves the way for a better collective reality

movements such as the civil rights movement or the suffragette movement did not succeed simply because people were willing to break rulesthey succeeded because the individuals involved understood the broader implications of the norms they challenged they recognized that these outdated rules served only to marginalize and divide this kind of rulebreaking required a willingness to endure social disapproval to risk personal safety and to maintain a steadfast vision of a more just world it required hypersanitya profound awareness that transcended the superficial sense of order driven by a deeper understanding of what true justice and equality demanded

on a personal level growth involves breaking the rules within ourselvesrules shaped by our upbringing past experiences or societys influence many of these rules are internal boundaries that once served a protective role but now limit us hypersanity involves recognizing which of these rules are necessary boundaries essential for wellbeing and which are outdated beliefs that hinder personal evolution growth in this sense means dismantling those limiting beliefs with insight and replacing them with more expansive perspectives

we are often taught rules about what is possible for usrules about our capabilities our worth and our potential many of these rules become internalized as limiting beliefs and they restrict our ability to grow and explore new possibilities breaking these rules requires deep introspection a willingness to face discomfort and the courage to challenge our selfimposed limitations it means seeing beyond the restrictions imposed by fear past failures or societal expectations and embracing a version of ourselves that is continuously evolving hypersanity guides us to see that true personal growth involves not just selfimprovement but the dismantling of internal constructs that keep us confined to a limited version of who we are

the wisdom to break selectively

through the hypersane lens true wisdom lies in the ability to selectively break the rules that no longer serve us it is a balanced approach that requires knowledge foresight and accountability rulebreaking when done wisely is not merely about the thrill of defiance it is about transformationit is about understanding the intricate dance between what should be preserved and what must be dismantled to make way for something greater

this selective practice demands both courage and awareness it is a journey of acting in alignment with ones values even when those actions defy the expectations or norms that surround us hypersanity provides the vision to see beyond the status quo to understand the dynamics of power control and potential and to act in ways that honor growth connection and truth

the key is discernmentknowing when breaking a rule will serve the greater good and when it may cause unnecessary harm it is about acting from a place of awareness rather than ego when we break rules in a hypersane manner we are not motivated by the desire to prove ourselves right or superior instead we are motivated by a deeper understanding of what needs to change for growth to occur it is about bringing more authenticity freedom and depth to our lives and to the systems we are part of

by cultivating the courage to break the rules that hold us back we allow ourselves to engage in a dynamic and meaningful process of growth this type of rulebreaking is inherently creativeit involves not just rejecting old limitations but envisioning and building something better in their place through hypersanity we gain the insight to know which boundaries are meant to be respected and which are meant to be transcended leading us toward a life that is more expansive liberated and aligned with our highest values

ultimately rulebreaking through the hypersane perspective is about honoring the potential for growth in all its forms it is about trusting in our ability to discern wisely to challenge courageously and to evolve continuously it reminds us that true progresswhether personal scientific or societaldepends on our willingness to question the old and dare to create the new",DemonicsGamingDomain,Anarchism,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ietmz6/anarchism_propaganda_rulebreaking/

2025-01-31 05:43:57,on the topic of censorship and criticism of the left,"for starters i dont consider myself a leftist i consider myself a revolutionaryradical the topic of censorship expands beyond my criticism of the left because censirship can happen with individual people groupsanfd just overall it can be a societal problem 

im no stranger to censorship and critizing online spaces the reason why censorship is problematic is because it doesnt allow for open discussion conversation and valid criticism of particular rhetoricideologies peoplegroupssocieties can be so sensitive as not to allow such criticism of their beliefs and ideologies ive encounterred censorship many times simply for giving honest opinions or critique of certain views and reddit as a platform is well known for its censorship habits it can be irritating 

censorship for me is unappealing because it sends the message that peoplegroupssocietieds are closedminded and  lack critical thinking censorship severely limits growth and critical thinking and expansion on philosopical thinking 

anyways i feel as though the left is pretty authoritarian its filled with authoritarian leftist that believe that state socialism and state communism is possible when in the past revolutions with russia and the soviet unionussr and china with the ccp have failed because these system reproduced state capitalism simply by referring to these countries as socialist or communist isnt accurate to what socialistm and communism is defined as 

socialism is classified as workers having free association and ownership over the means of production and the abolition of the capitalist class and their monopolization of the means of production and workers control

communism is defined as a moneyless stateless and classless society none of which the ussr and the ccp have achieved therefore they arent socialist or communist for many authoritarian leftist they have a visceral reaction to this criticism which led to me being banned from the sociallist reddit forum which is precisely why i criticize the left and dont consider myself a leftist because of their authoritarian views with statism socialism and communism


we can never move forward and make progress if we cant have opened minded discussion or people not being to sensitive with their ideologyrhetoric censorship prevents this and it precisely how its supposed to function by suppressing free speech and having certain biases to the more conformist or favorable ideologiesrhetoric 

i believe its an oxymoron to say that a country can be socialist or communist and operate in a socialist and communist ways countries serve the purpose of nationalism statism imperialism and colonialism





edit i made this post to critque the authoritarian left and biased censorship so if youre not an authoritarian leftist this post isnt for you and if youre not a biased moderator that censores people because they have different political opinions then these criticism are definitely not for you

2025-01-28 20:53:25,anarchists in municipal government,"hey there for a long time ive held views that align with the anarchist spirit of challenging power structures and removing them wherever possible at the same time ive often thought about what the ideal utopian society would like or at least what a society transitioning to that could look like ive been paralyzed because ive seen no path for me other than as a naysayer a complainer a whiner a critic

ive read a bit and done some thinking on my own and ive basically arrived at the conclusion that human beings are essentially organized into hierarchies and systems that are extremely messed up with state power at the national level being the common enemy hanging over all our heads as i think anyone on this sub might agree 

i dont believe its possible to attack the nationstates from the topdown and be stateless at any point in my my life and i dont believe in an everymanforhimself way of life either i believe that full human potential is unlocked when we work in harmony with the earth and with each other thus some level of cooperation is necessary

ive been inspired by reading bookchin and by reading about sewer socialism and now believe that cities and towns may be a good place to start making serious changes to get people more engaged in democracy in managing the little piece of earth that we share in figuring out how to share our limited resources and so on

i am considering running for local office and want to bring along a vision for radical change based on some of bookchins ideas i want to make democracy more inclusive i want to emphasize quality of life over more standard economic indicators that the businessmen who usually sit in my local government champion  i want our city to put the environment more at the forefront of every choice we make i want to stop spending so much on police i believe it should be everyones longterm goal to abolish police or radically redefine what policing is who wants to imagine a world where crime will always need to be fought by bullies with guns

what do folks think of this vision what are some ideas you have about how to take notions of fighting the power into local government",newnewengland,Anarchism,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1icc0ej/anarchists_in_municipal_government/
2025-01-28 17:45:50,linkedin protest and action,"please consider participating in a political protest on linkedin  linkedin hosts an international mixed audience with influence and money  corporate government and religious bodies are exposed  a considerable fraction of its users are sympathetic  over the past few days i did a test run and had some success  i did not see much concurrent resistance activity but there is quite a bit of existing political discussion

i began with my authentic linkedin profile  i have worked as a us engineer for a few companies and had around 500 contacts  i do not think linkedin is particularly useful for career purposes and have not been very active

i believe my most successful tactic was targeting company posts  as an example many companies with millions of followers made posts celebrating mlk jr day  on these i commented company name ceo name what is your opinion on musks nazi salute  i then liked the company post and reposted it to my account with the same comment as a description

i also commented on a few corporate disclosures  as an example a germany company posted a video where the ceo talked about political changes improving business prospects  i wrote something about these policies being similar to those of the afd and asked whether he supported elon musks salute  i happened to be the first commenter and believe many people saw this  individuals with inside and industry knowledge could gather considerable attention in this way

i interacted with both conservative and progressive commenters  many of my statements were upvoted or argued  i am not sure how effective this was but it is somewhat visible

i posted a few news articles  i am not sure how effective this is because it was hard to get impressions

a few people complained that my behavior was not work appropriate but i think most users are in favor of free speech

over about three days i accumulated about 300 profile views and 4000 impressions  some very influential people with job titles like vp and chief communications officer viewed my profile  people from all over the world viewed my profile  a royal liked one of my comments  women seemed particularly sympathetic and courageous  this was a test run and i am not particularly well versed in social media

it is possible to directly post articles videos and reddit content  i think it is possible to generate fake accounts with nothing more than an email  someone named elon musk with a picture of elon musk liked a comment

this morning i woke up to find that my account had been suspended  it took them 3 days to do this and i suspect they can be overwhelmed  the email indicates that this is due to potential identity theft  i was asked to provide images of government identification to restore access  i do not know if my account will be restored

i also received one warning for hate speech  this warning threatened potential account suspension  i had written fuck trump  i do not think this is hate speech  this comment was up for something like 15 days before i received the warning  using language like fascist and nazi may or may not be recommended but i was very aggressive

i understand many people are hesitant to participate due to exposure at their job  it was very difficult to get upvotes from my network  i am not sure how many of my previous contacts were online but only one person had the courage to like an article that i posted

thank you for taking the time to read this  if you like this idea please help distribute it across reddit and anywhere else  i have been a reddit lurker for about 3 years but have limited karma and am unable to make my own standalone post",[deleted],Anarchism,18,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ic7do8/linkedin_protest_and_action/

2025-01-27 04:22:06,theres a shift,"i keep an eye on this forum however i see flaws in revolutionary and radical thought here 

most revolutionaries still have this ideal of a revolution being about anarchist anticapitalist antiauthoritarians overthrowing the system of state and capitalism overnight through vanguard militarized action when this is not only a power fantasy but it wouldnt be useful or effective on actually changing our material reality it would only reproduced a capitalist and statist system

a revolution is a series of uprisings resistances and revolts against current political system that exist which dont work or serve in favor of the masses while we cant plan an anarchist society because it would be a finality a revolution does take strong horizontal power structures and planning  and proper selfdefense against fascism and statism 

i feel as though its easy to talk about revolution online and discuss theory but its takes more energy and effort to put in the praxis for many people whether youre a radical or not we often love the idea of community but lack motivation energy or time commitment to craft the society we want to build mostly due to a hyper individuallist society we already live under we tend to pay attention more to our personal issues which is valid and revolutionary action isnt going to look the same for everyone internationally we all deal with different varying degrees of oppression that need different solutions when it comes to praxis there isnt a formula that fits everyone


its easy to be lazy in thinking and praxis about revolution especially for those that are already dealing with hyper individuallism and isolation which is my case as well its especially more of a challenge when theres a task of educating people on anarchist views the bedrock of revolution is people recognizeing their dialectic material conditions learning about the oppressive institutions they must eradicate and educating other people in the processes forming mutal networks etc however class consciousness comes from societies having to experience the destructive natures of a system

in the case of the american empire it is in major decline and has been for decades economic crisis environmental crisis with climate change and illnesses inflation etc its an empire thats in denial and its the working class that will suffer from the decline not the demagogues or the capitalist the problem is that many people still buy into the electoral system every four years hoping for change because thats much easier than the effort of direct action for some 

anyway a bit of a rant but i just find it weird and irritating how many people still have this belief that a revolution will happen overnight through militarized vanguard action when its more complicated than that and revolutionnary action isnt the same for all of us across the globe i also find it extremely weird how some people believe the state will help in the  anticapitalist and antistatist revolution history has shown that when theres any opposition that is a threat to the state that it will eliminate its opposition through force and coercion",Ok-Instruction-3653,Anarchism,28,234,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1iazoxn/theres_a_shift/
2025-01-27 02:12:01,we are more than cogs we are the revolution,"for too long weve been fed a lie a lie that were free that this system works for us that if we just work hard enough well achieve the dream but look closerthe dream is a mirage designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards the few those at the top have declared themselves gods ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe

the truth is harsh but it must be said we are nothing more than cogs in their machine spinning endlessly to make the rich richer the powerful more powerful but if we cant live free the system cant stand

weve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle that there arent enough resources so we must compete fight and claw for scraps but thats another lie think about this there are over 333 million people in america aloneand the reality is we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production to live sustainably and still thrive theres enough land food energy and technology to create a society that ensures every single persons survival and dignity

so why dont we because this system thrives on greed corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry theyd rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit theyd rather exploit our personal data manipulate us with marketing and push endless consumerism than admit the truth this isnt about meeting our needs its about feeding their power

they sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires theyve turned our lives into commodities our data into currency and our labor into fuel for their machine the system wasnt built to serve usit was built to enslave us but our unity their downfall

history shows us the truth from the gilded age of robber barons to the billionaires of today the system has always been rigged corporations crush workers to cut costs politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder wars are waged to protect profits not people many voices one movement is their greatest fear

but heres the thingthey only win if we stay divided theyve spent decades pitting us against each other left vs right rural vs urban black vs white its a strategy straight out of orwells 1984 they want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy because they know the truth we are more than cogs in their machine we are the revolution

think about the power we hold together we outnumber them a thousand to one together we are unstoppable they control the wealth the media and the laws but none of that matters if we refuse to comply if we unite resist and rebuild we can create a system that works for all of us not just the privileged few the time is now unite resist rebuild

this isnt just about tearing down their machine its about building something better a future where no one is exploited for a paycheck where no child goes hungry where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo its about reclaiming the dream theyve stolen from us rise as one reclaim the future

we are done begging for scraps from their table were done watching as they strip our communities of opportunity while lining their pockets were done believing the lie that this is just the way things are no gods no mastersonly freedom

they want you to feel small powerless but remember this their power comes from us every hour we work every dollar we spend every time we stay silent fight the few empower the many if we withdraw that power their system crumbles

we stand at a crossroads on one side is the broken system they want us to accept on the other is a future we can build together a future where were no longer cogs in their machine but the architects of our destiny the choice is clear their system our power one reckoning

2025-01-26 14:02:29,do you think we need more radical left wing grifters,"ive been thinking a lot about right wing grifters like candace owens and ben shapiro and how people like that managed to drag online discourse so far to the right even though they might not necessarily truly believe the things theyre yapping about thought many of them definitely do the way theyd constantly be the first to try dominate the narrative whenever something even vaguely progressive or leftist happens even if its just performative stuff like representation in movies or whatever 

i feel more and more that we might need to take greater control of the narrative and shape our messages to resonate with and radicalise the normies in a decentralized populist movement kinda way 

where other people slightly to the right of us either a bit more authoritarian or capitalist or whatever it may be are in an environment online that we actively attempted to make hostile to anything vaguely right wing ideas the same way they did it to us when they were portraying us and our ideas as irrational or going too far or unreasonable 

basically flipping it on them with our own grifters or public figures and yappers and comments section takeovers where we make sure everything is centered on what we wanna talk about 

i feel like we have a better leg to stand on because leftist ideas have almost always directly improved peoples quality of life when implemented even slightly fairness kindness empowerment cooperation self expression connection saving nature and having a thriving ecosystem all these things are pretty easy to sell i think so if we tried as hard as they did to market ourselves itd be a clean sweep

2025-01-26 10:25:47,i am an anarchist and have really always been one,"this is mostly a rant about my process of self discovery leading to anarchism if you dont feel like reading a redditors summarized ideological life story feel free to move on to another post but thank you if you decide to stay 

i am very happy to call myself an anarchist after several years of floating in the political limbo of not adhering strictly to an ideology i grew up protestant in the us and from there i naturally became a good ol american neoliberal as i would have called myself a christian conservative when i was an older teenager that didnt last too long as i only adhered to that ideology from growing up in that environment but deep down i knew that wasnt really who i am even if i didnt realize that at first 

a few existential crises later i was floating around in an ideological void after leaving american christianity behind hanging out with my two new best friends who happen to be a tankie and an anarchist how they are such close friends being so ideologically opposed in many ways is another interesting story entirely on its own i began to realize ive always had a pretty left leaning personality and values but now id fully get the chance to express them in their totality but i had a choice to make i was surrounded by auth communism along with anarchism at the same time and i couldnt choose i had convinced myself that anarchy wouldnt work and that the auth commies had to be right who would run air traffic control in an anarchist commune i thought so i called myself a marxist for a little while it didnt stick i kinda hated it actually my body rebelled against the label 

another year or so went by and the answer ended up being a lot more simple than i ever would have thought what do i want to live out as my own life and help welcome the world into and that answer is anarchism i dont like state power structures i dont like vertical hierarchy i hate oppression theres hardly a worse feeling than the weight of authority upon ones being i want every human being to have no one above them no one below them none be forced to bear the weight of nations none be beaten down by the force of the state 

other answers followed from there whats stopping us from running air traffic control we dont have to have a hierarchy to do it all it takes is action and coordination

a lot of ideas i had for a very long time have begun to click one after the other even when i was immersed in american protestantism i always disliked the power structures in church and school and wondered why we couldnt do things differently and actually be fair to each other and help each other like how some kids went without lunch cause they couldnt pay for it ive always thought money to be such a stupid concept

2025-01-25 14:46:00,korean january 6 election fraud myth still haunts our society,"yoon sukyeol insisting election fraud in public announcement

anticommunist and altright rioters raiding seoul western district court entry

lack of evidence  freedomhouse american neoliberal ngo

ok ive written many articles about the current south korean crisis however i didnt mention the crucial point of this unrest the election fraud conspiracy theory the result of rightwing populism and authoritarianism in our society and thats why im explaining about south korean rightwing populism and its election fraud to my comrades in japan taiwan hk tibet mongolia china singapore vietnam the philippines myanmar thailand laos cambodia brunei malaysia indonesia east timor papua etc

1 background

hk comrades teaching the cops a lesson with molotov cocktails

yes we were all depressed when hk comrades despite fighting valiantly eventually knelt down to chinese imperialism and authoritarianism 

however in south korea the situation was perceived a little differently

right over s korea is north korea and beyond it are china and russia two antiwest fascist dengistputinist regimes

as you know south korea has been always prowest while north korea along with china and ussrgtrussia have been mostly antiwest due to such reasons the term nkcnru has been often used and korean rightwing often seeing them as communist or excommunist dictatorship regimes became extremely prowest and japanophile

therefore when hk protesters who were british prowest 23 years ago lost to china a communist i mean state capitalist antiwest country south koreans were extremely shocked since it might be koreas next future

jews are genetically inferior but they are controlling all banks and corporations  nazis

these anticommunist and antiantiwest sentiments combined with antichinese racism including antikoreanchinese racism since korean chinese are often seen as brainwashed chinese who are no longer korean turned into the significant conspiracy theory

2 china gate

the first of all

in 2020 when the legislative election was coming soon a rightwing user who insisted that he is a korean chinese said that liberals are chinese proxies and proliberal prochinesepronk antijapaneseantiusa and anticonservative replies and tweets are written by chinese agents 

according to this writing many internet users discovered the suspicious activities and believed that proliberal opinions on internet are dominated by chinese agents and that the election will prove it

however the result was liberals taking more than 180 seats out of 300 while conservatives barely covering about 105 seats

3 result denial

2020 legislative election was a hoax scanned the voting papers and printed them again not punishing the election fraud leads our country to destruction  ok unho

due to cognitive dissonance many rightwing populists started believing one thing they won but due to chinese manipulation they lost

despite the government and journals repeatedly arguing against such conspiracy theory it still remained popular toward senior evangelicals and anticommunists

hopefully the election of conservative yoon sukyeol seemed to resolve the conspiracy theory

4 resurrection

the chaos of rok was invoked by election commission  jeon hangil

yoon sukyeol himself turned to believe such theory  according to former centrals he said my election was kinda weird too i should have won the liberal in distance of 1015p but it was mere 073p how

and it turned out that yoons as well as martial law forces primary object was investigating the election commission and persuading the officials and politicians to confess that there were election frauds

yoon sukyeol himself insisted that the country was in serious problem due to chinese election intervention and that was why he declared martial law to fix the problem

the propangadized proyoon protesters now including not only evangelicals anticommunists and mccathists but also altrights xenophobesislamophobes and homophobes started chanting stop election fraud reporting proliberal entertainers to cia and m16 and even rioting in the court

5 conclusion  opinion

as you learned through this article rightwing populism fueled with mccarthyism and authoritarianism is trying to deny the reality this ironically emphasizes the importance of factchecking in our activities

keep these lessons in mind comrades in japan taiwan hk tibet mongolia china singapore vietnam the philippines myanmar thailand laos cambodia brunei malaysia indonesia east timor papua the usa canada mexico ukraine greece russia belarus germany france the uk romania hungary serbia montenegro bosnia croatia cyprus italy spain portugal ireland australia brazil argentina turkey azerbaijan armenia kurdistan bethnahrainmesopotamia balochistan tajikistan pashtunistan syria iraq iran lebanon circassia chechnya jordan jewish and arab palestine western sahara saudi arabia uae qatar south africa etc thanks for reading",[deleted],Anarchism,0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i9ofgo/korean_january_6_election_fraud_myth_still_haunts/

2025-01-25 04:42:30,organizing for the long haul,"the functioning of the autonomous government schools and clinics as well as other collective projects is financed by earnings from cooperatives and land collectives these are at the center of zapatistas aspiration to reach economic selfsufficiency from the state and to build an economy based on equitable distribution of resources while cooperatives and collectives coexist with family land and individual entrepreneurship participation in collective work on a rotating basis is obligatory 

there are also popular banks in the form of revolving funds that make lowinterest loans to members of the support base communities these banks generate funds that get invested in new collective projects some collectives are womenonly and intend to provide an opportunity for women to gain confidence and participate in the social life of their communities

that is mutualist banking


why dont anarachists in the us try starti g a mutualist bank micro loans do not require all that much money we have lawyers and doctors and nurses would it not be enough to invest part of your savings or retirement in a mutualist initiative and have low interest returns that also help grow anarchist worker empowerment in your community

2025-01-24 21:36:47,ive failed to effectively get involved with community organizing  where do i go from here,"i hope its okay to ask this here  this seems to be one of the only subs with discussions about broad community involvement unless i overlooked something 

the election cycle has whipped up a lot of fear and anxiety as usual and in response there are a lot of calls to get organized and become involved within your community as usual i dont mean to sound dismissive or jaded its just that at nearly 30 this isnt my first rodeo but i am feeling very small and very ineffective this time around 

i live in the deep south one of those blue dots in a sea of red type cities it likes to project itself as progressivelyminded but its just very statusquo liberal still i was able to connect with some more radical folks out here there arent many and it felt like there was hope for forging community and strong connections and doing good work 

but i ended up having really terrible experiences with local community organizing efforts the most upsetting was with an anarchist group that i worked with for about a year which ultimately kicked me out of the organizing space for being lgbtq and neurodivergent  in their words it made things awkward and made other people uncomfortable then proceeded to steal from me and threaten violence against me 

i moved on to other projects and groups but they all fell apart one project that really felt like it was going to make a difference ended up selling out for corporate funding and threw its principles under the bus other groups and organizations lost steam and membership as folks moved away or lost interest and eventually folded their chapters and others that ableisttransphobic anarchist group ended up taking over 

for awhile some of us tried to start our own community group amp independent projects but the oftgiven advice just organize the communityset up mutual aid networksdo the projects yourself is so much harder than it sounds in practice we realized we didnt have a lot of experience under our belts but organizing veterans we appealed to for guidance were burnt out and wanted nothing to do with any more of it so we just gave it our best try and i know the idea is that if you set an example folks will see and become involved but that isnt what happened definitionally this isnt work that can be done by yourself or with just 2 or 3 people the logistics arent possible we didnt do a damn bit of good but we sure exhausted ourselves spinning our tires in the mud 

get involved get organized make a difference dont look away dont choose inaction ive tried and ive failed im not in a position where i can support anything financially i dont have the experience the knowledge or skills to found something new from the ground up im trying not to be just another burntout jaded old timer im trying not to be defeatist or apathetic i still try to do what little i can but its not enough where do you go from here",TaterTatras,Anarchism,14,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i96phc/ive_failed_to_effectively_get_involved_with/

has android with localcloud support for your vault and works flawlessly  see keepassxd for andoid no ads 100 private

who know how fast data could shift hands

as someone thats housebound i cant really do much so ive been trying to teach myself tools and learn as much as i can as quick as i can  so that i might help in a different way

works exactly like proton but everythings stored in a vault thats encrypted uses 256 and can modify security of each vault

this is actually awesome because if someone gets the vault it would take them ages to brute   
but you can just sync it from any cloud at the same time

i recommend burning a vault into a dvdusb to ensure youre covered

 ai

if youre going to use ai use an llm if you can afford a beefy enough pc  
there are still smaller models that some older pcs can use

besides the popular llms etc theres also the need to organize your knowledge privately

this is where you can privately use a lightweight llm inside obsidian like smart connections

onceif you setup linux look into a private voiceassistant like mycroft or sepia framework  literally a 100 private ai like alexa but worth it

 obsidian

be weary now of services like notionevernote etc more than ever obsidian as is  your data is only yours and local

you can zip your obsidian and attach to a keepass vault to keep it secure on a togo usb

obsidian has a feature called canvas that allows you to map out notes in a virtual whiteboard you can embed videos and basically anything using whats called an iframe

make a control center canvas for different things like learning linux

 learn linux to what degree you can

i only started learning very late in life and linux has always confused me  
i personally like mint 22  but have had a lot of trial and errors before getting my own as a custom iso

ive been learning enough with ai like braves free and private temporary chats ontop of my private gpt you can even connect your own llm directly into the browser and it can read anything you want it to

start copying tutorials into obsidian with an extension like markdownload which allows you to scrape a pageselection and deliver it directly to your obsidian  this will allow you to have references if you lose internet

after learning some basics and having python packages installed and apts like fsearchgedit etc  
after getting your ideal updated distro use something like cubic to make your linux with your own files included into a larger iso

you now have a complete rescue usb that has your keepassvault and any files you want etc

i havent gotten far enough to see about encrypting the usb so more research is needed otherwise could store the iso in a passworded zip or vault etc

setup your own private cloud nextcloud you can host it on your linux with some setup that will require time but is literally your own cloud service

can also repurpose old phones to act as servers pseudo raspberrypis

 brave browser

i started using brave since it has tor builtin and uses a unique way to sync devices not using a typical password method but a set of phrases that change

it still has sync its private ai leo can also be switched with your own llm

just a ton of features i never knew existed before i switched

due to how secure their sync method is if you lose all your devices you wont be able to login to a new device you have to be logged into one to be able to sync

a workaround is just copying your brave files into a keepassxc vault

i dont know if it is been written before but i was not able to find it up so i will start doing little by little a list of free media around the world keep posting on it comrades maybe someone of us can think that a media is free but other comrade can have info against this assert so lets keep calm lets discuss with serenity and construct this list toghether but first of all lets discuss what is a free media here my suggestions

with free media i mean

a must

1 are not accepting money directly from a bank think tanks political parties or capitalist groups insurances weapon industry a big income must be by suscription or ethical advertisements

2 can be public or private but not accepting interference of politicians can accept goverment advertising but without being the main income

3 journalists inside can be working fulltime parttime or freelancing they must receive a decent salary far from the interprofessional minimum wage and that allows them to live where they live in a dignified and selfsufficient manner

4 they correct mistakes they have made publicly

5 they support freedom of speech and information and they will help even to their competence in such problems

6 support and accepting material from local journalist or freelances on the ground paying them well for that video photo and writers

7 once per year minimun they show their incomes and also salaries of the workers but not the names for privacy they dont especulate with their money

8 not using  clickbait titles and subtitles 

a desirable

1 using free software or at least mit license for their webpage or blog 
2 not using fascists social networks like meta x google
3 not selling information of the suscribers to any third party business
4 using creative commons licenses

i know that is difficult right now to have all the criterias ticked but lets mark the most free media collaborating in this subreddit fo example xxxxx media has 63 means that they have 6 big ticks and 3 little ticks

please help people knowing from where they are informing

  when you have grasped this simple truth you start to see how your basic freedoms are being infringed by the system that we were conditioned to live in  

    a cop pulled over ivan lopez in somerton arizona a small town near the mexican border the officer claimed that lopez had a broken taillight and had been speeding 
   
a drugsniffing dog then indicated possible contraband police searched his truck and found fentanyl cocaine heroin and meth 
   
lopez subsequently agreed to a plea deal where he would serve 84 months in prison for drug smuggling

   the traffic stop was in 2018 lopez  and his lawyers didnt find out until 2020 that it was neither the traffic offenses nor the dog that led to lopezs downfall it was location data from his phone which revealed he was passing through the border at a place where there was no monitored crossing 
   
  a secret underground tunnel led from mexico to a property he owned in the arizona border town of san luis
a handful of smalltown border cops hadnt been actively monitoring lopezs phone location they were purchasing the information from thirdparty brokers who were collecting gps data produced by the apps on lopezs phone

 byron tau then a wall street journal reporter reported that year that the federal government particularly immigration officials had begun purchasing such data which had typically been meant for use by advertising companies 
  
it was tau who told lopezs lawyers about the data purchases in the course of reporting his story
 
   in this way both local and federal police were bypassing fourth amendment restrictions to get information that would typically require probable cause and a warrant",Fabulous-Tadpole-520,Anarchism,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i7lwh7/your_freedom_is_fleeting/

below im sharing a list of such techniques and id love to hear your thoughts

 meetings especially daily or very frequent ones corporate meetings are always hierarchical youre assigned to speak by someone else or you never speak at all as an employee they serve as a method of enforcing compliance with corporate processes and are also a means of reinforcing hierarchies and controlling your workload and daily tasks theyre afraid of time theft

 lunch and learn in some companies free meals are offered with the condition that employees attend corporate brainwashing sessions during their break about how awesome we are as a company

 the company as a family the tired old clich that we are a family here attempts an emotional blackmail strategy aiming to make employees feel obligated to go the extra mile for their family eg unpaid overtime

 employee surveillance tools a classic and extremely invasive control practice under the guise of enhancing productivity

 pizza fridays afterwork drinks and other social bonding events these socalled job perks that many consider cool are actually distractions from meaningful raises improved working conditions etc they also serve as a compliance and submission tool to the companys doctrine eg if an employee repeatedly skips such events they are demonized ridiculed and ostracized

 managers and hr managers are not part of the working class they belong to a different class pmc  professional managerial class they monitor you assign tasks reprimand fire you etc essentially they are the bosses watchdogs within the workplace hr exists solely to protect the companys intereststhey dont care about employees at all

apologies for my lousy english but i would really love to discover more of these techniques so i can recognize them better from now on feel free to share your insights suggest relevant booksarticles etc

2025-01-21 10:13:39,reflections on studiesjobs  are studies this needed in the current world for a good job,"hello everyone 

i hope this does fit the guidelines here and stays on topic i wanted to ask here due to the values and interests we share i figured this would be one of the better spaces to ask then

i am a student and feel like pressure is put on me especially by my mother in order for me to get a good diploma and follow higher studies an engineering degree for example the reason for this is something along the lines of this idea 

think of it this way suffer through the schooling for a little bit to set yourself up for the rest of your life as a wonderful friend of mine put it so likely something along the lines of wellpaying jobs and job security

but this seems to be a very strange idea to me i find that from when i was born to today where i will soon be back on studies i just spend so much time learning studying yet nothing to get a job now and be done with it all or no support from my environment to do exactly that i feel like most people try and convince me to stick to those studies but i am genuinely confused as to why i couldnt just not follow higher studies at least for now and do something with my life

the things i could actually do right now to help give to the community are majoritarily if not all things i learned on my own or outside of school  using my proficiency in english as a french native for translation work cooking which could be used to help communities knowledge of softwareit which i could use to help communities and specific people with technology such as the elderly i could find more examples if i took more time but i hope this gets the point across well

since the start of those higher studies i also questionned myself on some things mainly 

 do we really need to follow higher studies or at least the bigger ones such as engineering to have good stable jobs as a young leftistanarchist im really doubting of the idea that we have to suffer through the schooling to set oneself up for life 

 what would those studies bring to us both as individuals and for our communities  so many people talk about doing higher studies but i just struggle to find why wed have to follow those to help people build a better world is it just because of capitalism and the like

im so confused by this idea i imagine i can do things such as urban planning but this only really works when governments want to use urban planning for a more socialecological environment so why focus on this as a guarantee if we can help our communities and people in similar ways without relying on those higher studies is following those studies really so important

sorry if this is all a confused jumbled mess of words as an anarchist and young adult its very hard to make a place for yourself in this world ive tried to think about those issues for about a year and a half now but still do not get anywhere im really lost and i dont know if anyone would have anything to say on the matter i also hope this post is not interpreted as antiintellectualism im not against the idea of higher studies at all moreso what those studies realistically lead you to do in the current world along the fact that we already have much of the knowledge we need to move forward and probably dont need to findinvent more things

i hope all is well for you and have a great day 

 much needed tldr

i feel i am pressured into following studies more specifically engineering studies as they ensure a better job security and salary this idea makes me feel alienated because i struggle to understand the point of studies in a capitalist world given everything we can already do to help communities without those higher studies most of what could be done to help communities thanks to studies of mostany kind such as philosophy seem to have to depend on either governments which seem increasingly farright or capitalist corporations which would go against the interests of people at large im aware that its slightly hard to live a life distanced from capitalism but if one wants to be as close to this life im not sure of if following long studies would change this pratically im also not very convinced of the idea that one has to do such studies to live a fulfilling life you give meaning to yourself studies dont give this meaning to you im also pretty sure you can make job security work with such goals and that if you live frugally the lower salaries wont be much of a problem",arni_ca,Anarchism,1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i6fh7k/reflections_on_studiesjobs_are_studies_this/

im not finished yet so its possible hes going to tell me what he thinks the answer is but id like to have a discussion about what perhaps you all believe the answer is 

so the question in the world of an anarchist in our current world or perhaps after a successful revolution whowhat would take on the role of the primal father as defined by freud here is a quote from the essay describing the concept the primal fatherthe ultimate and original patriarchhas absolute power over his sons and demands from them devotion and obedience the sons fear the primal father equally thus creating a bond and sense of equality and community between them

here is how im viewing the situation for anarchists the primal father is the state but i think thats only the most obvious answer and perhaps others have more interesting interpretations 

the quote above is followed by this however as the fatherthe archetypal absolute sovereignenjoys unrestricted access to all the women of tribe prohibiting it to the sons the sons band together to kill and devour the father yet so the myth goes this ultimate transgression creates a sense of collective guilt amongst the sons and thus the law against incest arises i will return to this later as it has important consequences for this discussion the removal of one form of prohibition does not necessarily free us as internalized constraints come to the fore to take its place

2025-01-19 22:20:29,reclaiming neoluddism from the technophobes,"when i see the term neoluddite online i often see people like ted kaczynski brought up technophobes rather than the technoskepticist that make up the majority of the decentralized movement just like how the original luddites were painted as antitechnology when they were really just opposed to the centralization of industry and its place over their lives i just want to state that i am not against tech i love technology i love computers i love the internet i love video games as a millennial these were my childhood if you knew me irl you might think i was a retrotech fetishist someone who is obsessed with web 10 and the aesthetics of the 2000s while that is true i have my reasons

the current state of technology is that of classism militarism surveillance and exploitation of resources labor and the environment i am not fine with tech being used in such ways and that as anarchists we must stand by our morals and search for a way to undermine it here are a few things i propose for other technoskepticsneoluddites

 minimalist tech buy an mp3 player or a higher end dap if you need it learn how to torrent and or just rip the tracks off of your own cds prioritize dumb devices that have specific usages over smart devices fhat have connections to the internet smartphone is your worst enemy it is a distraction a surveillance camera and a tool of psychological manipulation i would suggest buying burners or flip phones over high end products like iphone or galaxy too buy a handheld console that boots roms stuff like that dont use streaming services dont pay unless you are paying to support the development of the media or to own the data forever
 digital minimalism this somewhat ties into the minimalist tech but i thought i would make its own section limit the time you spend on devices this doesnt exactly mean spend less time on digital devices especially if thats your job or outlet for activism you might want to but to use them with intent limit your devices that are connected to the internet have a singular device that is for using the internet the internet is an extremely powerful tool for activism spreading awareness sharing media and opinions but it can be a double edged sword when going in blind and or if you are vulnerable to their manipulation such as if you are a gambling addict shopping addict etc breaking yourself from that connection that these corporations have over your attention is key
 software minimalism and modular design these are core tenets of the unix philosophy supporting using or creating simple efficient and accessible software a focus in smaller file sizes less resource intensiveness and ease of use is a way to democratize data and to make it more widely available to the general public the smaller the file the less incentive you have to delete it the easier the code the easier it is to modify to innovate and to learn from the more widely utilizable it will be for example take video games people in both first and third world countries can play games like minecraft together more easily they can play call of duty black ops 6 together and it will have more longevity and improvements as a result of its ability to be customized and played in almost any device
 embrace and host third spaces on the internet there needs to be places away from capitalist interest online there is a big attack on our freedom of speech with the tik tok ban on apps like twitter as well as facebook hell reddit is most likely a psyop whilst these can be good tools for outreach in specific instances they should not be your primary method of interacting with the internet or communication as they are multibillion dollar companies companies who do not have your best interest at heart as they have proven time and time again they steal your data they manipulate your perception they utilize algorithms to control the stream of information not good i would suggest sites like spacehey a myspace clone that allows you to customize your profile with html graphics music players etc it only takes donations and sells merch thats it free to use mastadon a decentralized twitter clone that hosts multiple smaller servers rather than just one discord a server hosting site where you can set up your own servers that have chat channels voice channels you can stream etc telegram a free encrypted messsging app that allows you to create group channels and share up to 1gb filesize great for hosting books information or just talking or substack a site that allows to write and share articles or hell make your own site ill be the first person on your message board

2025-01-19 05:52:46,alexander atabekians anarchist communism,"alexander atabekian was an armenian anarchocommunist he lived near the same time as the russian revolution and much of his writing makes reference to it he liked kropotkin in particular

i initially wrote off alexander atabekian for some reason i think its because i started with his essay on territoriality which was not the best place to start and doesnt seem reflective of his larger body of work if he had any larger works theyre not on the anarchist library but what is there is succinct and echoes other classicals with a lucidity that i wasnt expecting

ive never heard atabekians name come up in any anarchist discussion i guess it would make sense if he didnt write that much but ive heard reclus name he didnt write much either i dont think besides the geography so here is some stuff atabekian wrote which i liked i will link each piece to each piece theyre all very short

more than once atabekian uses power and authority interchangeably as i think someone like louise michel does he will also occasionally make reference to moral authority i believe this is a figure of speech however maybe similar in his diction to confidence he will just as or more often repudiate authority in its entirety and lays out clearly with direct reference to right a conceptualization of the latter that seems to easily fall within the authority held in contempt by other anarchists

gt what characterises anarchism what is common to all anarchists whatever their starting point and way of thinking is the rejection of authority the denial of the right of people to forcibly subjugate other people even if the power comes from a numerical majority diderot formulated this thought in the following words nature has created neither masters nor servants i want neither to make nor to receive laws

the old and new in anarchism


tangentially he has a second and uncompromising repudiation of democracy up to and including direct legislation

gt by its other basic property the free association of individuals with the right of each of them to withdraw from the association at any time cooperation excludes coercion being free and voluntary in its internal construction cooperation is hostile to external violence which is an inevitable property of state power politically cooperation can be neither monarchical nor republican nor democratic as v kilchevsky claims nor soviet since coercion is inherent in all power even under the most ideal state system under direct popular legislation of property equal people the majority subordinates the minority to its will 

cooperation and anarchism

he talked about bolshevism a lot he didnt like it his critique of class struggle particularly as it was understood and exercised by the bolsheviks i found resonant

gt thus capital from the largest to the smallest amounts are closely woven into the process of production exchange and distribution of products the class of capitalists is diffused throughout society and it is not possible to single it out into a separate class

gt class struggle is the frozen dogma of the faith of all socialists and even of many anarchists the terrible consequences of the widespread dissemination and application of this scientifically untenable theory in the ignorant masses of the russian people we have seen and experienced since the february revolution especially after the triumph of the direct heirs of the international  the socialdemocrats bolsheviks in close contact for the first time in history with their co heirs  the anarchists

gt after the october coup dtat which became so bloody thanks to the exaltation instilled by this theory the bourgeois began to be searched for but the search was in vain the crimes of capitalism were in plain sight but the criminal himself was elusive it turned out that the bourgeoisie as a class of people had been absorbed into the middle and even partly into the lower strata of the population it was possible to point to some individual rich people but even those have long since disappeared they continued to look for the bourgeoisie and in moscow they found it in the person of osip minor who had grown old because of his struggle for socialism in prisons and penal servitude and his comrades in the party in the person of the revolutionary officers and that part of the student youth which had rallied round the party of the socialistrevolutionaries while the other part had joined the bolsheviks and nightmarish events took place fraternal blood was shed on both sides in glorification of the new dogma of the faith of the ignorant people  the class struggle this dogma awakened the spirit of fanaticism dormant in every ignorant man and the darkest times of religious persecution were resurrected

the old and new in anarchism

a very kropotkiny line here i believe part of this might be a direct quote 

gt anarchy is above all the freedom of the individual bounded only by the equal freedom of another individual whoever he may be by conviction it is natural morality without sanction or compulsion

questions of theory and practice


anticoercion is a big part of his project which i agree with less but i do find parts of it enchanting

gt the anarchist who raises his hand to search another person even if only for weapons is no longer a proud ideological anarchist he is lower than the last policeman at least he does not hide behind the banner of freedom the anarchist who crosses the threshold of anothers dwelling to search it even if only again for weapons is a criminal against the high and pure doctrine which our ideological opponents consider unattainable

questions of theory and practice

so provided atabekians uncompromising antiauthority anarchy i see a complication of anarchisms ideological commitments that seems like it echoes through other places it is the ground floor for his anarchism opposing authority as a path to liberty and things of that nature

there are more pieces some on organization his talk here is similarly eloquent he talks much about approaching anarchy as science and speaks of trouble with anarchist congresses that couldnt bind their members and otherwise became fraught with disintegration and new authorities insofar as anarchy is science for alexander atabekian this is no problem because a conference is not where those decisions are made organization is concerned principally with what is possible  external constraints rather than consensus the decisionmaking of majorities etc and i think too a thread of individual works coalescing into collective action

gt just as the scientific congresses contributed little to science because no binding resolutions were possible and science develops and grows through painstaking laboratory and office work so too the anarchist congresses gave the comrades who came together an opportunity for personal communication and exchange of opinions but that was all they played no organisational role the modern anarchist movement has grown and consolidated in its original groups

questions of theory and practice

gt we are not talking about other inconveniences of the central organization lets just say that a large part of the armenian revolutionaries experienced the destructive and harmful influence of that center on their skin and was forced to withdraw from that idea if until now those centers have not finally destroyed the cause the reason is that the cause itself is an essential organic demand for the people and continues outside the centers independently of them and often against all of them

gt so in your opinion they answer us the general organization of the revolutionary force is impossible not at all the only thing that follows from what we have said is that we need to look for other means and forms of organization  that we should not work in vain efforts and in vain time to form a unity of yanun activity but we must work with all our strength for the yanun revolution from which itself gave birth to a union and a permanent organization

gt activity life develops a common plan of action for armenian revolutionaries then the place of current theoretical disputes will be replaced by a practical solidarity among various perfectly independent groups none of which will try to impose either its principles or its tactics on the heads of others and only then will we have a true organization  an organization that will arise from vital conditions from the efforts made  an organization that will be based on the direct and close relations of the working groups

revolutionary organization

some of his writing was on world war i in the problem of a free army he says that he worked as a doctor for two years in the russian army his description of the way wartime economics undermined capitalism is very interesting i dont know if its more wholly his or if he derives this from somewhere 

gt the world war destroyed the foundations of the capitalist economy while the october revolution continues its work and destroys the very forms of the capitalist system

gt war that factor of discord oppression and destruction this time became fruitful and constructive this was because in its unprecedented size and duration it shook up the entire economic life of the globe it became a literal war of nations and subjugated all strata of society to its equalizing demands

gt it has barely disguised the extensive expropriations of private property by the name of requisitions it has destroyed free trade by fixing prices it has sought to equalise all strata of the
population by food organisations for the equal distribution of essential foodstuffs in short the foundations of the capitalist system have been struck blow by blow and this not only in our own country but to an even greater extent in central and western europe the stronghold of class divisions governmental power has so far survived but even in it large holes have been punctured

gt this unification of all strata of society in western europe has already begun to bear fruit it is rebuilding the social order on new principles more methodically and firmly than we have in russia this reorganisation of the social order of the west is pointed out by kropotkin in his letters on current events and only due to poor knowledge due to the conditions of wartime we can not take a closer look at this creative side of life in europe caused by the current war in russia this association emerged and blossomed in the direction of social construction in the early years of the war it found a wide field of practical application rich material and useful experience in the activities of the allrussian zemsky union and other public organisations the business of organising aid to millions of refugees  to whole nations  became a school of practical socialism then the activity of public organisations spread to the greatest part of the population it was their fruitful activity that created our food organisations and developed the initial technique of supplying and distributing foodstuffs

the old and new

i thought his accusation specifically of the way authoritarian organization undermined the russian armys capacity to fight was interesting too reminiscent of bakunin who theorized that authority is caustic to expertise which alexander atabekian proposes that he witnessed in practice i do not know if this is grounded in good history but his perspective is neat

gt after the february revolution which was to change the whole way of social life in the whole country it was clear to everyone that the army could not retain its old forms it too had to be renewed what did the scientifically educated officers as a professional category do to point out to the broad layers of the people and the soldiering masses the right ways for renewal exactly nothing we had officers with solid scientific knowledge and combat experience but we had no officers there was no purely professional spirit of association among our officers standing beyond and above political and social beliefs and views the army was led not by united professional workers but by disparate officials appointed at the discretion of their superiors from above this is what ruined the army in the first place

gt the truth is that we did not have a purely professional association of officers on the basis of technical knowledge which would have enjoyed moral authority and would have been able to take into its own hands the work of army renewal from the very beginning our officers in the general mass without initiative without social outlook with their thinking squeezed into the deadening framework of routine were not capable of taking the lead in the reorganisation of the army on new principles and by habit became inert waiting for orders from above or clinging to the decaying old forms from above came the political agitators driven by the phantoms of the old power from above came demagogues chasing themselves after the power that intoxicates man the results  we have read them in the brest peace treaty and are reading them in mirbachs notes

gt from this point of view any anarchistrevolutionary  for defensive war is essentially an organised revolution against external state oppressors  can only welcome the initiative of military affairs it is high time to make military affairs purely professional to transfer them to the healthy ground of knowledge and skill instead of what do you want and i obey before the state power

gt authority can call any accumulation of people an army such as the red army but it cannot make it an army

the problem of a free army

with regards to territoriality and anarchism i have mixed feelings because i think there is an interesting point at the center of the work given a certain tendency to view humans and environments and organistic to each other although i do not know if thats a misapplication of proudhons unitycollectivity 

gt if we look closely at the life of individual animal families and their societies we will notice that each of them uses a certain place of residence  nest burrow den anthill beehive  and a relatively limited space of land ie the territory on which it harvests the means for its own existence and for the preservation of the species offspring even migratory birds and those at different times of the year return to their former home and old nest the same is observed in nomadic tribes which do not wander around the world wherever they see fit but have their own definite kyshlagi and eylagi as nomadic tatars call the places of their winter and summer stay

gt the connection with the homeland is so strong in man that even with the modern extraordinary development of communication routes people are very reluctant to move from their homeland and then only under the pressure of irresistible economic necessity

gt anarchism has so far put forward the territorial homeland  the commune  as its closest political ideal because it was easier to imagine and realise a just social order there but doom inevitably awaits the commune in a surrounding hostile environment as happened to paris in 1871 in order to establish itself anarchism must develop forms of organisation of large defensible units and then unite other countries more and more closely with its cultural influence this is the direction in which the revival of the anarchist international must be sought

territoriality and anarchism

im unsure about his usage of commune as a territorial homeland however now with the additional context of his other work im also not sure if hes using this in any particular national sense i dont think he is it almost seems like the essay is less about territoriality and more concerned with addressing the divide created by ww1 between antimilitarist anarchists and anarchists who supported the entente his point basically seems to be that neither option makes sense and that when an anarchist homeland is created a homeland within his concept being any locality where they live and are organized towards theres a coherent basis for attacking archic forces that want to assimilate it this seems like an unobjectionable position

theres some other things of his i havent read and i will now i feel comfortable keeping his work in my back pocket as a starting point for most people as much of this seems pure anarchism and not strictly anarchocommunism his collection of ideas seems like ittouches a lot of important bases and does it in an easily readable way

two last quotes that seem to wrap it up

gt theoretical anarchism is a science its practice must become an applied science

gt you have to act to organize action constant action  this is the only way to organization",Silver-Statement8573,Anarchism,2,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i4rr0t/alexander_atabekians_anarchist_communism/

so if you dont know about the freelm sub i think at first i was feeling like it was unfair and i think in some ways while i do find that its somewhat unfair i think i didnt remember at the time what happens when a revolutionary person and im not saying or not saying lm is politically revolutionary that theyre real politics become watered down we see this with mlk for example hes not seen as a black socialist hes seen as the guy that made a speech one time about having a dream and thats all he is for many people my mom whos a trump supporter seems to think that he would have been a conservative in some ways i think that tort got a better position than most i mean they did get a wikipedia page hehe whatever that even means for some people but my point is is that they were well known enough to hit somewhat mainstream eyes if you type in their name on reddit youll see that a few communities were talking about them i was talking to someone who is from puerto rico and is currently living on the mainland and he says that he heard of tort as well although at the time they didnt really know the details of the situation i think at the time i wanted tort to get more attention but now i realize that thats not always the good thing because not all attention is good attention especially when its a weird parasocial relationship attention where all of your baby pictures are posted stuff even when there is so far no evidence lm is guilty and the nature and conclusion of the trial does not prove without a shadow of a doubt it just means that he is either labeled guilty or not guilty by the courts innocent people do get charged sometimes it kind of reminds me of the true crime community where you have the people who are trying to treat it very seriously and be like sort of amateur detectives and tried to actually come to somewhat logical conclusions from the information that they have and then the people who post flower crowns of the shooters 

again im not trying to move mountains with a reddit post more just curious about what other people might say in creating a sort of interesting discussion

especially in the topics of the liberalization of radical figures parasocial relationships with people who are incarcerated who are in court or even just people who have gone down in history as doing something horrible and also sort of the nature of privacy when you are someone who is seen as a martyr like i almost cant help but feel like there might be some sort of feeling of entitlement or something as if another persons entire life or history is just public domain now that person is essentially a public figure martyr",Arktikos02,Anarchism,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i375rg/follow_up_i_am_glad_tortuguita_isnt_getting_as/

most adaptations ive seen show some of that but the moral is mostly altered to no life is perfect which i suppose is a good moral but in this day and age thats not enough id love to see a retelling where the rich person realizes how sheltered their life has been and how blind they were to the suffering of the poor and realizes they and other rich folk have benefitted from this injustice while the poor person realizes that high society life is stricter then they could have ever imagined and not as sophisticated as they thought

then both team up to topple the system and ensure a truly or at least massively more egalitarian society what do you think sound like a good idea",godzillavkk,Anarchism,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i33hsl/do_you_think_someone_should_do_a_pro_anarchy/

 internal conflict because i want to pursue a diplomatic career  which is a state job where you literally have to represent a countrys interest amongst its peers which nowadays im more or less relaxed in regards of this topic i mean i view it as diplomacy itself it would very much be needed in a poststate postcapitalist world but im still working on that one on this note if someone has any books about known anarchist diplomats or anarchistic views on diplomacy per se not a commentary on global state of art diplomacy id very much appreciate

but basically since ive restarted studying for the diplomats exam for my country and inevitably coming across multiple reasons for doomerism across our globe i kinda spiraled into a negative cycle trying to foresee a solution within known mechanisms and suddenly i remembered the impact that anarchism left in my life both morally and ideologically i dont know how to explain but it seems to me that even if you dont believe that anarchism is going to be a reality in our lifetime and hope is running out of fuel it doesnt matter thats the most humane stance and i wouldnt have it any other way",Queerlestrinha,Anarchism,19,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1i2qzmx/returning_to_anarchism/

2025-01-14 16:19:16,reactions to government spending cuts,"tldr thoughts on how to react to cuts to governmental spending especially when they target more socialist policies that largely benefit the working class

context

hey all i recently watched a few videos about how the conservative party wihtin the uk has effectively destroyed their nation in the name of budget cuts among various other actions within america we are about to have trump take office where his cronies in the form of doge the name is an eyeroll are planning on heavily slashing government spending destroying many agencies in the process

the anarchist position based is to eventually have a complete abolition of the state and of capitalism as well

my thoughts

it seems like many of these cuts are to bring us to a more minarchist state which is to say gutting everything in the government except for the most controllling and powerful aspects of the state these aspects being the police prisonscourts and military which are of course the most vicious aspects of state

i dont feel like theres anything to cheer about with these governmental cuts since it seems like many of them occur at the expense of the poor working class middle class and elderly individuals while retaining the worst asepcts of the state so how to progress

steps to follow 

1 we should vote and fight for liberallabour policies that maintain government spending not that im a go out and vote liberal or anything for public services that benefit society as a whole specifically the working class
2 at the same time we continue to target the most blatant uses of state power police prisoncourts and military via actions and movements like defund the police and get rid of forprofit prisons etc at the same time we continue to target corporations and focus on unionizationsyndicalist efforts alongside engaging in agorist black markets creating communes working to force corporations to increase pay bring back pensions and any other activity to undermine the power of capitalists  im open to suggestions 

outcome of steps

attacking the more powerful forms of state control police prisonscourts and military will reduce the most blatant and brutal forms of state power reducing the fear that can come from dissenting this reduction in power will be double important for when the nearly inevitable rush to fascism occurs in response to a growing leftist sect

furthermore fighting to get the government to increase spending andor socialize healthcare education and housing etc will drastically increase the amount of power the working class by removing massive financial burdens

the above in turn will weaken the control of capitalism on the working class especially when we factor in direct attacks against the capitalists

this in turn will create a more powerful working class who will have an easier time attacking other forms of governmental control and capitalism

this will fuel a continuous cycle that will eventually lead to a more anarchist form be it communism or market anarchism or whatever

essentially we give the working class some wins and show them that they can operate without need for hierarchies capitalism or a state slowly overtime

questions

should we be cheering these cuts to the government on if technically they are reducing the power of the state

or should we be fighting against them since the working class and fixed income individuals are going to get hurt the hardest by cuts to certain programs

andor are we to aim to destroy the most controlling aspects of state first being the police prisoncourts and military

disclaimer 1

while i would love to reach a purely anarchist form not sure if im anarchocommunist or market anarchist or im still reading i want to reach this form with the least amount of suffering involved this is very important to me

my biggest reason for not being an ml is related to the fact that many of these ml regimes seemingly lead the working class to their doom in the name of the greater good and take an any means to the end approach this is not to mention the layers of bureaucracy and power hoarding that occurs within the socalled vanguard party

i am not comfortable with sacrificing anyone in the name of any ideology

would this be characterized as harm reduction

disclaimer 2

please forgive and correct me if i misuse certain words or misrepresent certain concepts im still learning i promise i am trying my hardest not to be a liberal sellout or reactionary apologist i want to maximize freedom of everyone and remove the shackles placed on the working class and all of humanity

to actively prevent arrest of president yoon socalled white skeleton corps  appeared drawing controversy 

as supporters of president yoon anticommunist youth union  had a foundation interview in national assembly and announced that they will run white skeleton corps as a subordinate group yesterday january 9

when january 3 corruption investigation office for highranking officials cio tried to arrest president yoon young adults in white helmets protested against arrest near the president office

in open chatting room of anticommunist youth union announcements such as those who want to join the president civillain guards should find white skeleton corps member in white helmet or cap and call us and we are in the frontline against rioters so young men should come more were being made

white skeleton corps mean various riot police squads that wore civillain clothes and arrested protesters in demonstrations and protests in 1980s and 1990s

in 1991 kang kyungdea   a 1st grader in myongji university died from iron pipe used by a white skeleton corps police

kim junghyun  spokesman of anticommunist youth union insisted we are not being violent but in order to overcome ongoing crisis powerful method shall be used white skeleton corps and its strong image seemed adequate

they originally notified its inauguration ceremony and demonstration in 1830 that day but canceled later

organizations calling for impeachment of president yoon opposed to them firmly

immediate resignation of yoon seokyeol and great reformation of society  emergency action   criticized we cannot help being shocked considering what atrocities white skeleton corps have done in modern history

even korean confederation of trade unions  side condemned white skeleton corps is the symbol of violence savagery dictatorship and antidemocracy and if you are offended by cheering sticks light sticks calling for impeachment and bring billy clubs of white skeleton corps then you are rebels

not only liberal progressive  leftwing organizations but also conservative rightwing internet communities raised concerns that using the name white skeleton corps is inadequate

anyways ive always heard people say that a leftists biggest enemy is other leftists and i wanted to ask how you guys here feel about that personally i see it as just another talking point to solidify capitalistrealism and to take credibility away from socialist and anarchist beliefs and movements personally despite only scratching the surface of anarchism so far i see the liberals centre right and especially the upperclass as my enemies not other leftists that dont agree with me on every single thing ive always thought that if we want change we need each other and that we cant let capitalist propaganda divide us

  
however i wanted to hear the thoughts from here especially the general anarchist position on socialism socialist groups and movements while there is of course lots of range in socialist beliefs and models of society it is almost always thought of as a system with government obviously this goes against the goals of anarchism so like ive said too many times already in this post its late for me sorry not great at thinking is this

are the goals of socialist groupsmovements of a society which still contains government a hardline for you against cooperation or reason for limited cooperation or is it not an issue for you

i think his dialectical style of analysis of indigenous liberation movements and the consequences of colonialism are really interesting and seem really important to understand in framing any revolutionary movement 
this is possibly the best and most cohesive analysis of liberation movements ive ever run across so far 
if you know of another i should read feel free to recommend

2025-01-12 05:35:34,anarchism education and hypocrisy,"its probably a common feeling and also a bit strange and unfair but at various times i feel that my anarchist view of the world comes into direct conflict with important things in my life i am a public school teacher and an anarchist i am poor my students are poor my students families are poor my country is sunk in capitalist chaos and is one of the countries with the greatest social inequality in the world as a teacher and as an anarchist i try to make my students aware of this reality i use my subject to explain inequality and show them different opportunities they have to break the cycle to recognize generational trauma understand themselves more pay attention to mental health understand how capitalism works so as not to be sucked in by the system that dehumanizes people i do all this through demonstrations activities showing these opportunities in practice usually related to undergraduate courses that these students dont have much hope of getting into through the entrance exams making artistic graffiti projects to demonstrate cooperation and occupation of public space we painted the school walls among other things its never just a lecture telling them how they should live their lives its dynamic playful planned and smart and yet the amount of influence i have on these teenagers is minimal obviously friends matter and know more family influences more and even my fellow teachers end up influencing more i dont want to be the only reference in their lives but i often feel like im running into a wall that the cruel reality around me and my students is so much more powerful than me and also theoretically i work for the state government i have so much bureaucracy and responsibilities to fulfill that the little energy i have left is to do these things i said i do and i kinda work for the government so i feel very hypocritical even though i know that im not because im not a politician a police officer or anything like that im a teacher inserting myself in the public space which is where i will have the most influence

and finally what bothers me most is when i realize that i am being practically forced to replicate professional behaviors in the classroom that if i dont use makes it impossible for me to teach a class for example in some classes in some schools if i am not stricter or do not call the schools authorities such as the principal i simply cannot teach due to the indisposition and lack of respect i suffer from the students this lack of interest in education and lack of respect for education professionals in my country is so strong teachers are devalued and underpaid and are beaten in the streets by police its a culture of teacher hatred in rightwing media that preaches us as indoctrinators among other crazy things that have created this view among most students families that school is a place to spend time and have fun with friends studying doesnt lead to nothing students then arrive at school with this mentality and i understand where it all comes from but i have less than 1 hour with them a week how am i going to explain this to a 16 year old theres no way so i end up shouting taking them out of the classroom so i can make the most of the little time i have to teach those who arent like that and i feel terrible i studied so many beautiful theories about education at university and i can easily say most of them are rubbish all from people who have never set foot in a classroom and taught by university professors who have never even set foot in a public school anyway all of this leaves me confused angry feeling guilty and insufficient and all because i am a public school teacher and also an anarchist what do you guys think",Spirited_Peach_8776,Anarchism,10,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hzfv81/anarchism_education_and_hypocrisy/

what made you a socialistcommunistanarchist how did you become class concious

 were these seperate things for you
 was it a single event or moment you can recall or in your opinion more gradual
 how would you define your politics beforehand if you are comfortable sharing as in leftcentreright or broadly apolitical
 how would you have ideologically described yourself
 were you already sympathetic to socialismcommunism or were you the opposite
 how would you define yourself now anarchist ml trostkyist cliffite libertarian socialist and how did your experiences influence this
 what organisation are you now in if any how did this relate to the above if it all

feel free to answer just part of this rather than all the questions above if you dont care for it

ive been thinking alot about how this occurs lately thinking about if more theory could be developed on exactly how this occurs in people on a social and psychological level

im also just very curious to hear about peoples experiences across the left

edit to add my newest comment

since people seem to think im coming at this from some sort of ignorance rather than a difference of undertstanding perspective or opinion i thought id provide some articles explaining my point of viewperspective some what as its understood where i organise this isnt to say opposing views arrent valid but that both are equally valid and they are fine to be discussed as so

i think the most defining one of any would be this one



  
  
  
  
  


please note if you disagree thats totally fine but this is the perspective in which i was asking the question and thats just as valid as anyone elses here but im getting time and time again people seeing socialist next to anarchist and making value judgements about myself with regards to that",Remster123,Anarchism,114,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hzb4hz/what_made_you_a_socialisthow_did_you_become_class/

2025-01-11 20:28:52,fascism is capitalisms lightning rod,"while researching different fascist movements both past and present i have noticed a peculiar set of similarities between them beyond their defining palingenetic ultranationalism

1 they gain popularity in the times of economic strife utilising populist rhetoric to rally the masses around fascists promises of economic revival and denouncements of ruling moderate politicians  mussolini exploited the disillusionment and poverty of italian wwi veterans hitler promised to rebuild german economy from the great depression and the treaty of versailles le pen and trump both built their support on the popular anger at the effects of neoliberal policies
2 they are backed by the economic elite  eg hitlers campaign was funded by german industrialists while trumps was bankrolled by elon musk and shielded from criticism by jeff bezos
3 they redirect the popular outrage at dire economic conditions away from the capitalist class towards a scapegoat  for hitler it was the jews the communists the gays and the trans people for le pen it is immigrants for trump it is the immigrants the woke and the trans people
4 once in power they quickly abandon the facade of proworker economic populism and readily serve the interests of the owner class  mussolini banned strikes and nonfascist worker syndicates hitler privatised most industry trump assembled a cabinet of billionares and multimillionares two of which are now in charge of deregulating their own industries

these facts have led me to theorise that a key function of fascism is to act as a lightning rod to capitalism  when the latter creates infuriating poverty and inequality that could result in a mass anticapitalist revolt fascists sweep in backed by the funds and propaganda provided by their elite sponsors to redirect the popular outrage towards their chosen scapegoat and seize state institutions for themselves

this ingenious symbiosis between capitalism and fascism is quadruply dire

1 it preserves capitalism with its exploitation and authoritarian working conditions in spite of the popular rage instilled by its socioeconomic consequences
2 it bolsters capitalism moreso than typical liberalism does by placing authoritarians indebted to their corporate sponsors or said corporate sponsors themselves in key regulatory positions within state bureaucracy
3 it causes severe often lethal systemic violence towards members of the scapegoat group
4 it turns otherwise decent people into bigoted lunatics through repeated exposure to conspiracy theories propagandised by corporate and following a fascist takeover state actors for the benefit of both actors

2025-01-10 16:57:35,my idea for an eat the rich arg aternate reality game,"times are tough and reality is bleak to put it mildly  and nothings going to get better ever  we are stuck in a deathspiral into absurdity accelerated by our own worst collective human traits

so what options do working class people have to stave off the infinite existential horror of suffering in a posttruth capitalistcontrolled hellscape ruled by the limitless potential of human corruption and greed propped up by a framework that ultimately rewards those qualities

rot doomscroll endure the exploitation as something inevitable and natural etch words into your shell casings

marios brother is on to something but the potential power of an act is limited by the collective reaction  if any  to it all lone wolves who commit similar acts of violence usually do so in the hope of being the spark to set off some broader movement and there is never any real social change except through community

ive been trying to brainstorm some collective spells we  as unwashed plebs  might try casting in an effort to change our shared material reality for the better memes we might conjure to inflict psychic damage on some thing that exists physically but without a body  like money

how do you guillotine the head off of an idea

if one person doing something is an issue one hundred is a nuisance ten thousand a concern one hundred thousand a problem and by one million were at a fullblown unrelenting and unstoppable force of nature

so  the game

its very simple  we can all interact with it and watch as it changes on a daily basis the very existence of the game might immediately effect its rankings and narrative and any person that wants to can interact with it however theyd like

a website with two lists on each side of the page  on the left is a list of the wealthiest individuals in canada  you do not need anything more than a name and a net worth in billions  see wikipedias article on list of canadians by net worth

on the right hand side of the page theres a second list of causes of death  any billionaire that died would have an equal number of points assigned for each dollar equivalent to their net worth when they got entropied  so for example since james k irving recently passed at 96 peacefully in his sleep well assign about 55 billion points to natural causes which is likely to be our all time top scorer

if we wanted to go retroactive and include barry sherman wed assign about 3 billion points to the murdered  unsolved category  probably not going to find its way to the top 5 an outlier for sure

now anybody can join in when and as they see fit  if they felt a moral obligation or were just looking for something fun to do on a sunday for example

nothing left to live for 

maybe for the highest score of all time

each country could have its own national leaderboard with a separate list for the international league which is when things would really get interesting  everybody in the world can play together

since the points assigned a category for a wealthy individuals expiry are completely made up meaningless and without any actual value outside of whatever social value certain groups might apply it cant really be argued that the game website or list itself is inciting violence or soliciting murder  its simply a set of lists  how the greater public decides to react engage and participate with the lists is what determines how the game ultimately plays out  and how an alternate reality might merge with the one we inhabit now

actually eating a billionaire will net an additional 10000000000 points  because why not

hi everyone a confluence of recent events both at the national level as well as within my own little city have led me to believe that people are more receptive than at any time in my life to the ideas of the left socialism communism anarchism etc

im 38 so i remember following no wto protests through punk bands that were vocal about it the war on terror occupy dapl blm the 2016 race where bernie seemed credible as a national candidate trump and im probably forgetting other formative events

i grew up working class with parents who voted both democrat and republican they always seemed to have a heavy dose of cynicism and skepticism toward politics and mainly voted exclusively in presidential elections but i remember saying to my dad once when i was 8 or 9 something like you vote democrat because republicans are for rich people and democrats are for poor people and were poor i still remember his response no they are both for rich people

over the years culture wars and disinformation led my parents to become trump voters and here is my main thesis i believe that the some of the same energy that exists among trump voters could be tapped into by those of us with more fairminded egalitarian points of view

for instance my city has a problem with our police force being violent and unchecked with the worst of their crimes being exploitation of sex workers i had a conversation with my mom about it mentioning id gone to our city council to complain about it and she told me that back when she was a kid women knew not to go into certain towns alone for fear of sexual violence from predatory cops this really made me feel like there could be some common ground regarding distrust of authority and breaking destructive power structures

seeing so many people vote trump at the same time that luigi mangione became a folk hero i am into anarchy amp peace btw made me realize that there is a massive amount of people that are dissatisfied with the status quo while i obviously loathe trump and believe he has hurt and will hurt many people perhaps for decades to come i believe that he reflects a mirror back on the worst parts of american life he should annex canada and greenland if only to make it clear to the world that yes the western world is basically ruled by the usa the nefarious hegemon due to our excessive military spending as well as our highly consumerist culture that makes us the troughslurping pigs of the world while allowing an underclass within our own borders to suffer under the covers

i believe that if we keep preaching things like distrust of authority breaking sick power structures and try to move away from all these tired leftright democratrepublican false dichotomies we may be able to reach some allies among trump voters and people that identify as rightwing or conservative

tldr shared distrust of authority coupled with a growing awareness of systemic failures presents an opportunity by focusing on dismantling oppressive structures and challenging the tired leftright paradigm we can build bridges with those who despite their support for trump yearn for a more just and equitable society by engaging in honest empathetic dialogue that centers on shared values and a collective vision for a better future",newnewengland,Anarchism,111,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hxdeli/opportunity_stop_using_the_old_leftright_paradigm/

2025-01-08 18:33:48,critique of mutual aid,"hi all

ive been part of a mutual aid group for the past couple years that is explicitly anarchist abolitionist and nonhierarchical our main project is cooking fresh nutritious meals for unsheltered folks each week and we also have a propane program where folks can get free propane to stay warmcook we also distribute harm reduction clothes etc 

ive recently been exposed to critiques of the mutual aid project from the socialistmarxist point of view i know one common critique is that much of what is packaged as mutual aid often isnt very mutual which i think is a valid pointmy group is always brainstorming ways to be more truly mutual such as giving opportunities to the our unsheltered neighbors to come help cook and distribute meals to the extent that they want to not as an obligation that being said i think even when mutual aid is fairly onesided the distinction between how a horizontallyorganized nostrings attached project operates and a neoliberal charity or church is significant enough that i dont have a huge problem with the phrase mutual aid

the critique that has given me more food for thought is over strategy the arguments ive seen say that mutual aid is essentially just a bandaid that doesnt address root issues which frankly i think is a pretty uncontroversial thing to say that no one i know in the ma world would disagree with where i understand the point is that maintaining a wellfunctioning mutual aid group is incredibly time intensive and in theory that time could be spent helping politically organize in a way that would more directly grasp for the levers of power that could ultimately redistribute wealth in a way that would benefit far more people far more greatly than cooking meals every week ever could 

i have access to wealth and have donated a lot of money to more rootcause political projects but realistically i work full time and contribute what free time i can to ma because i like being involved in my neighbors and because it helps people in the here and now part of this is admittedly a bit selfish i get more satisfaction from ma than i have from helping with political projects which is important for my mental health as an individual in our capitalist society i also love being part of a community that takes care of each other though ive heard socialists critique the focus on community over the focus on a society and the idea that ma groups are little islands of solidarity whereas the marxist project is to unite the working class across the country and world towards a common cause one thing i feel is missing from this aspect of the marxist critique is that in my experience lots of trans folks are attracted to mutual aid im a cismale for what its worth and i think part of the reason it speaks more to them is that our society is largely very hostile to them and while im all about class solidarity this a reality for a lot of marginalized people that i dont often see addressed from the marxist lens

anyways this is kind of a jumble of thoughts but just wanted to see what people who are more anarchistinclined like myself think about these critiques of ma would our time be better spent on political projects that have the possibility of achieving a greater good and if so what would that practically even look like",GeorgeGervinTheGOAT,Anarchism,83,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hwr9ut/critique_of_mutual_aid/

i tried again today ended up pretty much skimming it i just couldnt put more energyattention into it without feeling like im gonna have a despairrelated mental breakdown

i made it to the end just skimming and it doesnt really seem to lighten up at any point what am i missing how is it supposed to be antidoomerism if pretty much the whole point of it is well never create a better world authoritarism won forever the climate is fucked forever and most of the human population will be dead

bodily autonomy the right to choose abortion the right to medical contraceptives such as iuds the right to change your gender through legal and medical means

the taxation of the rich

universal health care

forcing companies to acknowledge their affect on global warming and do what they can to limit it pollution and other harmful practices even at a cost to revenue and shareholder value

ending lobbying in america and dismantling the first past the pole voting technique in favor of the approval rating system

defunding the police to any extent enforcing much stricter training policies

i wanted to make this post because we get a lot of palestinians or scam artists pretending to be them in here posting donation links in a previous thread i linked to unrwa and operation olive branch as official sources to donate to 

it has now come to my attention that operation olive branch are reporting their former volunteers to the fbi these former volunteers had their own issues with oob but left peacefully and to my knowledge didnt try to cause them any issues oob have used their lawyer to tell these activists that they have been reported to the fbi and are now under investigation 

i think this is absolutely sickening but not surprising and this is enough for me to no longer consider oob as a legitimate humanitarian effort its quite clear that they have chosen to weaponise a system of corruption and oppression against activists they dont like and given how aggressively cops and fbi are cracking down on propalestinian protestors its a deliberate attempt to get them taken care of permanently its likely that many of these activists are people of colour which makes the weaponisation of these systems that much more insidious 

if you want to donate to palestine please donate through unrwa not trying to convince anyone to donate they have an interactive map feature to track the aid going in operation olive branch do have a master list and i think that could potentially still be a good resource but i would not get involved in any tangible way with them anymore stay safe

the answer is that we wont know until we try not really we can theorize all day but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of anarchism i dont like to speak for others so ill just say that i believe people can govern themselves and that means letting them figure out how to do it best provided that if anyone tries to exploit anyone else we all gang up on them and put a stop to it

the thing i love most about anarchism is its elegant simplicity hierarchybad thats it the rest will work itself out the only reason things havent already worked themselves out is that we live in a hierarchical society

seriously everything ive ever read on the subject seems to just boil down to very smart people trying to convince everyone else that it really is that simple which it is

so stop trying to plan it out so carefully accept that its a flexible system by design and that any question which crops up over the course of its implementation will find an answer that suits the moment and might change later

2025-01-06 16:37:13,on happiness,"we are told happiness is something internal that depends solely on ourselves on our attitude on how we think that it is a mental state independent of reality and this point is driven into us by innumerable examples of martyrs of stoics and ascetics of whom it is said achieved a supreme degree of happiness nirvana in spite of or even thanks to the extreme deprivations and earthly pains they endured

this i hold to be false happiness is a product of our quality of life thats why danes are happier than greeks danes are asked what is the secret of happiness but they never give the right answer purchasing power material comfort but only if it is generalized in society because the perception of poverty causes sorrow even in the souls of the rich thats why rich southafricans hispanics and chinese cant have peace and live in fear and flee their countries to live in copenhagen and zurich

we are told the opposite so we look within ourselves for what is to blame for our misery so we do not attempt to change our circumstances but rather live and die doubly miserable tortured not only by want but also by an unfounded guilt as unhappiness is seen as a failure a character flaw and not as a symptom of living in a bleak and diseased world so that we do not understand that in order to be happy we must make our societies more like danish and norweigian societies

and that means revolution it means dispossessing the rich from the means of production they have hoarded and distribute them among the workers it means toppling the old institutions and authorities and establishing new ones that ensure true democracy popular sovereignty and therefore equality and generalized wellbeing institutions that are accountable and transparent decentralized power that is close to the people",justgotone1question,Anarchism,16,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hv373j/on_happiness/

fast forward to today weve finally moved in to the new side of the house and now my inlaws want us to rent out the other side as an income property i really dont want to do this for a couple of reasons i hate landlords and the entire concept of doing it my fil has had to evict many tenants from his own rental properties throughout the years and i just dont think i could do that the entire concept of owning anything to rent it out just fundamentally conflicts with what i think the world should look like spoiler alert im an anarchist as well

weve discussed doing seasonal airbnb stuff which also makes me feel sleezy so that wed have it open as an apartment that my mother can stay in if she wants to visit she lives across the country and is retired

2025-01-04 18:07:14,how do we feel about flagburning as a sign of resistance on january 18th weekend,"recently trump threw a hissyfit because biden ordered flags be flown at halfstaff in honor of the late jimmy carter and the flags will be that way on trumps inauguration day the big orange toddler wrote the democrats are all giddy about our magnificent american flag potentially being at half mast during my inauguration trump wrote they think its so great and are so happy about it because in actuality they dont love our country they only think about themselves

so how will he react if there is a nationwide flag burning festival
flag desecration is not illegal in the united states because it is protected by the first amendment as a form of symbolic speech

crimethinc has been calling for festivals of resistance  on the weekend of january 18th  i think trump would really get his panties in a bunch if his sacred symbol is destroyed in his name as a sign of resistance wouldnt he

or if burning doesnt work for you perhaps we fly the flags out of our cars and pickup trucks the way the falsepatriots do except ours are caught in the doors or trunk lids and dragging on the pavement instead 

or if we want to be a disruption on inauguration day would traffic grind to a halt if a few of trumps magnificent american flags were lying vulnerable in a washington dc intersection or tumbling like tumbleweeds down the middle of the capital beltway

and finally as a way to raise money for a good cause perhaps we could start a flag burning challenge along the same lines as the popular ice bucket challenge of 2014  if so what cause would be appropriate

 well4ward
are you watching the world go from bad to worse and feeling powerless to do anything
we need your help to find a way forward
well4ward is a housing reform initiative focused on raising funds and providing start up and ongoing support for a new model of cooperative housing the goal is to get people and communities direct ownership of their homes and help them set up what they need to maintain it these distrubuted and interconnected cooperatives form the foundation for community investment and rebuilding a human centered society but to get this launched we need some help covering the legal and start up costs weve set a goal of 3000 this will cover the cost of a lawyer who specializes in the types of bylaws we will need to protect the integrity of our new start up and set us up for successful growth if we raise more than that it will go to the costs of developing online infrastructure to support this initiative  a fully featured website and community network think of this as an investment in social change and let yourself dream that its possible things could get better again if we work together

in 2024 we worked on two longform animated essays which both required quite a bit of research the first one escape resistance and solidarity  farmed animal sanctuaries as the heart of the movement is an exploration of the solidarity we can extend to exploitedfarmed nonhuman animals through the sanctuary movement and beyond it the second natural gas the bridge to climate disaster narrates the lies the fossil fuel industry has been telling us for decades to keep us hooked on what theyre selling its also a dedication to climate activists everywhere before working on these two we created three videopoems in solidarity with palestine which were screened at a few fundraisers we also held a speculative workshop imagining multispecies education got the 2024 jen angel anarchist media grant made new stickers and a zine based on one of our animated essays for 2025 we have another two longform animated essays already planned  this time they are both somewhat related to animal politics and animal liberation from different angles and we hope well be able to make some more videopoems for palestine as well and continue working on the drafts we started sometime ago every year we have bigger expectations than what we actually manage to do but this is what keeps us going

ive joined af2c mid spring and shortly began to collaborate in the propaganda amp graphics communes as well as well4ward not too long afterwards through the few months here ive created multiple posters including full fledged artworks which while outside my comfort zone definitely helped me to work on my art skills and try different approaches to design the animation for well4ward in particular has had a major impact on my capabilities and i feel like it has improved my stroke confidence by a mile overall im glad im here and i hope to be able to contribute more in the coming months ive met quite a few kind comrades here and hopefully will meet many more in the future

i am new to anarchism but i was thinking about how you could allocate scarce and valuable resources to important societal projects listening to david graebers convo with peter thiel about the future this is one of the most interesting conversations ive ever heard   was really inspiring to the notion that anarchism could scale very well and actually be used to create technology in a more efficient way than capital accumulation 

like in a global anarchist scenario what if you used blockchain technologies to give people 5 example number monthly votes toward resource devotion for big projects  say a goal eg solving climate change or going to mars that would become a percentage of available resources

am i just reinventing money here or a plebiscite please recommend any literature on anarcho futurism in some ways they seem incompatible certainly technology would look different but i also could just as easily imagine the ways in which it could be useful to create maintain and upgrade such a society",crab_boy_1,Anarchism,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ht8yuu/blockchain_resource_allocation_for_big_projects/
2025-01-04 09:17:13,reasons for lack of libertarian socialism in south korea,"as i explained before libertarian socialist movements in south korea are in terrible status let me explain more

mccarthism and fear of north korean fifth column

since 1953 south korea has been under threat of north korean attack and since north korea is a state capitalist in other words state wage slavery state mccarthism is common in south korea korean militarist tyrants such as pak chnghi chn tuhwan and no taeu have brainwashed koreans that socialism  communism  ml  stalinism  north korea  dictatorship  totalitarianism even the concepts of nordic model or social democracy are shunned here i hate those ideas too no matter how generous your tyrant is you are still a slave

normalization of control

due to longterm dictatorship here control of state and police is normal here guns are nearly 100 forbidden and worker strike or demonstration is often accused of nk and chinese agents that try to spread chaos in society if you bring the ideas of squatting or illegalism here well good luck

social darwinism

our social studies textbooks teach us that capitalism lets you earn what you deserve based on your talents and efforts if you search on slum and the homeless on internet they are like well you should have studied hard in your youth or so what you want to steal our private property for your welfare such ideas were especially promoted during military dictatorship period when south korea had to exploit her people as hard as possible in order to be a developed country 

hostility on femenism and idpol

to satisfy our complaints on social injustice liberals have made some lipservices  there are ministry of gender equality and family and many feminist organizations however most of them are terf and selective feminists when they illegalized the pornography while advocating male only military conscription many people started believing that feminism  female supremarcy not only feminism but also whole liberal idpol is despised by many young 2039 men and centrist conservatives got much popularity via antifeminism

sabotage of ml

many leftist areas such as parties ngos and labor unions are overrun by mls such as progressive party so libertarian socialists have little place here

christian fundamentalism

although i am a born protestant presbyterian christian and attend to church every week i should admit that christian fundamentalism is severe here due to influence of american evangelicalism many christian organizations here  notably esther prayer movement  and intercp  are based on fundamental ideas you can see korean flag american flag israeli flag and cross together in many south korean farright marches and demonstration while christian rate is roughly 25 in south korea fundamentalist ideas such as homophobia islamophobia and patriarchy are widely spread can you believe that there is only one church  sumdol presbyterian church that openly welcomes lgbts and it is designated as a heretic church by roughly half of south korean protestant churches

despite these adversities and hardships i am convinced that we  not only south koreans but also our compatriots in north korea  will with the help from companions in japan china taiwan hong kong mongolia vietnam thailand myanmar indonesia the philippines etc create humanitys happiness for ourselves and all in 1198 man jk fought right in this land against class system and in 1812 hong kyngrae rose up here against feudalist exploitation we are descendants of man jk hong kyngrae kim chwachin and yi hoeyng and we will let the people command and the government obey",[deleted],Anarchism,4,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1htaq00/reasons_for_lack_of_libertarian_socialism_in/

since the overwhelming majority of historical and contemporary anarchistlibertarian socialist movements revolutions and rebellions the paris commune in france revolutionary catalonia in spain and makhnovshchina in ukraine the zapatistas in mexico and rojava in syria respectively have shown the possibility of socialism working in practice but not ticking the boxes of the usual oftenexaggerated critiques of state socialism authoritarianism famines human right abuses and mass murders antisocialist propaganda towards anarchismlibertarian socialism takes the form of erasure instead of the usual propaganda of commission whereas positive claims are accused the soviet union is bad and so on it has manifested as a sort of propaganda of omission forget anarchism exists there were no historical anarchist movements and so on this paves the way for easy simplistic and uncritical critiques of anarchism so that those who if ever encounters it will just easily dismiss it as a fringe impractical ideology with no reallife applications and also divorced from the rest of the socialist movementmeaning the rest of the labor movementhence the everyday worker

2025-01-02 16:51:23,the city of elgin illinois just declared war on all houseless folks living there noise demorally saturday jan 4th at 1pm,"the city of elgin has 
declared war 
against all unhoused people
its time to fight back

on the night of december 19th 2024 in a city hall courtroom of only a handful of people elgin city council members approved and celebrated a plan to eliminate tent city along with all other tents and selfmade structures that act as shelter made by those living on the streets this plan was discussed and decided on without the knowledge or presence of the hundreds of houseless people living in elgin

tent city located on roughly 8 acres between the fox river and route 31 in elgin has been a site used for encampments by people experiencing houselessness ever since the demolition of a metal fabrication factory there back in 1990 for many of these residents this is the only space in the city that offers safety and accommodations that allow them autonomy over their lives with this autonomy the residents of tent city have spent time and energy over the years building and sustaining this community 

the city of elgin plans to evict all residents of tent city along with the hundreds of other houseless individuals residing in tents and selfmade structures around the city of elgin moving only 50 of them to the lexington inn amp suites for a duration of four months this hotel is widely known for bed bug and cockroach infestations along with sanitary conditions that only barely meet city code

there is currently no plan for housing after the four months has ended 
we know this is a temporary solution assistant city manager karina nava said 

all houseless individuals including those selected for the fourmonth stay at the hotel are ordered to immediately vacate the premises of their encampment or face trespassing charges after every resident is evicted from tent city in particular the site will be secured and cleared and remediated furthermore the city promises to instate a zero tolerance policy for any future tents and selfmade shelters leaving those who are unable to access options provided by the city at extreme risk to the impending winter temperatures presently and longterm

rather than meeting houseless people where they are where they feel safe and investing in resources that could help them rebuild after two recent fires the city of elgin would rather spend more money and resources by evicting them all subjecting them to the trauma of forced displacement parks superintendent greg hulke estimated the cost of the eviction and clearing to be between 2 million and 25 million with the process taking two to four months not including the cost of the relocation of the selected 50 residents

while safety has been said to be the reason for all of this it is abundantly clear that the real motive is the same beautification process seen happening in many other gentrified cities what this eviction plan fails to reveal is an antihomelessness motive integrated into the citys vision of boosting property value 

elgin police chief ana lalley said the department will begin the process on or about jan 20  
the unhoused people of elgin deserve the autonomy to determine their own living situations
this plan is not a rescue  it is an eviction and for many people it may be a death sentence

2025-01-01 15:18:57,south korean yoon seokyeol regime has tried to remove the legacy of the anarchist anticolonial movement,"sources and related articles korean anarchist movement south korean new right and hong beomdo

im a teenage student in south korea and thats why my english is awkward though i am not an anarchist but a libertarian socialist like bookchin and ocalan recent events brought me here to write a really really long article about how our government has tried to erase anarchist antijapanese resistances from 1910 to 1945

as you know korean anarchists fought bravely when japanese imperialists occupied korea kim chwachin and his crews made an autonomous zone in korean diaspora in manchuria and there was even a small secret guerilla army

after the independence all the south korean politicians  leftwing nationalists centrist liberals centrist conservatives and hardline conservatives have acknowledged anarchist roles in korean independence just just recall how ukrainian farrights try to downplay makhnovshchina as if it was just a ukrainian antirussian nationalist organization the same thing has happened in south korea for 70 years especially because south korea had to prove to korean diasporas  chaoxianzu zainichi etc  that south korea is legitimate korea and north korea has to do nothing with korean independence activities

however things have changed when yoon seokyeol a supporter of newright came to power as you see in the article newrights  that korea before the occupation was a feudal state that deserved to collapse and that japanese empire came to korea to modernize and industrialize korea just like how chinese propaganda says about tibet they believe that korean independence activists were terrorists and that their modern counterpart is north korea they say that they are antinationalists that fight against chauvinists but they uphold japanese nationalism

so with fascists like this yoon seokyeol tried to denounce korean anarchism and its legacy they tried to remove the busts of various independence activists including kim chwachin from korea military academy they said that they were alleged of collaborating with commies despite kim chwachin having been assassinated by an ml even lee hoeyeong another anarchist was considered a commie

other three  independence activists  who were not anarchists  were accused of being communists as well however chi chongchon and lee beomseok were rightwing nationalists and hong beomd while participating in ussr communist party never upholded ml for a single time also hong beomdo died before north korea was established so he has nothing with north korea but all of five were accused of reds

in contrast south korean dictator park chunghee the greatest idol of south korean conservatives and newrights participated in workers party of south korea in late 1940s this shows how contradictory they are

not only that but also look at this written in korean

 yoon huiseok conservative                          for example general hong beomdo as i told you before when the bust controversy surged participated in korean communist party as our army has to fight under liberal democracy system against the systems enemies

                           and also when it comes to general kim chwachin he was active in northern jiandao  since near northern jiandao were socialist communist countries kim chawchin must have been related to such forces too 

in this routine newrights are continuously trying to remove anarchist struggles in korean independence movement

tldr

1 our government has caught schizophrenia it believes in some brainwashing like socialism  communism  mlm  north korea  dictatorship  totalitarianism and militarism  anticommunism  liberal democracy
2 therefore our government is a strong supporter of mccarthysm
3 and thats why our government has tried to remove anarchist legacies of korean independence activism and made a selfcoup last month

the following lectures arent specifically about anarchy but i believe they offer valuable insights into contexts that are deeply relevant to anarchists regardless of the specific adjectives we might use to describe ourselves
they explore topics such as anticonsumption representation racism mass incarceration the militaryindustrial complex abuse interpersonal violence patriarchy misogyny and other important issues within gender studies

2024-12-29 11:18:00,what does effective anarchist propaganda look like in todays world,"when people ask what they can do to contribute practically as anarchists the usual answers seem to be join or start a local mutual aid network or look for your local food not bombs group 

historically here im thinking 1860s to the late 1930s anarchist practice had two main strands

 building support networks that could replace existing hierarchies 
 education agitation and propaganda 

both libertarian and state socialists were using education agitation and propaganda in the decades leading up to and after wwi in practice this involved organising talks and debates at social clubs village halls or union meetings talking at public speaking pitches putting up posters and distributing socialist newspapers and socialist literature 

the environment these activists were working in was completely different to the modern world with no tv or internet people voluntarily went out to hear activists speak just because it was something interesting to do in some places public speaking pitches were almost competitive arenas with speakers vying for the largest crowd everything was new and people were often fighting for basic rights people werent yet jaded by the failure of unions or socialist parties to deliver on their promises

nowadays we have an almost unlimited worldwide audience for propaganda and education but it is easily eclipsed by all the other noise films tv internet and the ever present advertising of consumer goods in most developed countries people arent fighting for basic working rights or a basic standard of living the nuclear family and home entertainment have drastically reduced the amount of time people socialise in public or communal spaces

modern anarchist propaganda often seems to take the form of subvertising or similar stunts that subvert the language and tools of consumerism to me this seems to be preaching to the converted and not effective at conveying a message to ordinary working people 

are the approaches to education agitation and propaganda that were effective 100 years ago relevant today if not what is",DrPappa,Anarchism,13,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hou1dj/what_does_effective_anarchist_propaganda_look/

2024-12-27 08:45:06,power as cancer its not about states,"i see many posts of people talking about anarchism as a place you can reach but i think its much more as a state of being because power is like cancer it can corrupt a society coming from anywhere it can be through charisma brute force personal connections it can be trying to maintain an organization or position long after its socially useful the corruption of institutions its always there theres no point where its permanently defeated 

but we evolved psychological immune responses to it so we root for the underdog distrust the powerful  and i believe being an anarchist is being very deliberate about it strategizing and collaborating to fight power without the aim of taking it for yourself but it also needs creative aims positive goals so its worth fight for and doesnt devolve into pure reactionary violence

and its important to have a sense of priority different groups are always vying for power and a risk for the anarchist is going against the already weaker group helping the stronger one just take over when the spanish come to your land its probably not the best time to riot against tribal leaders or stop making weapons

right now we have the richest men in the world the president of the most powerful country most big names in decentralized finance in a small connected clique 

the ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nationstate are closely related peter thiel said as he joined with elon musk to try and allow everyone to move money fluidly

in europe one of maybe the most bureaucratic organization ever conceived is leading the fight against big tech investing billions to provide free open alternatives in hardware and software that can help guarantee our freedoms these are strange times it may well be that the end of the state at this moment would be the worst thing to ever happen to anarchism

with enough technological superiority the rules of the wto on ip we may end up in a stable de facto world government and because the violence is outsourced to the statelocal elitespmcs and the information is filtered by big tech we dont even see how it went wrong or who to fight if we even have the means to do so other than maybe china or the eu i think no one can pose challenges without a coup corruption charges a forex crisis the opposition suddenly swimming in money   but the natural resources are de jure under democratic control in most of the world and preserving it has a decent support people can control data information flow ecosystems communities so in a way the path to being an anarchist was never more clear",ComprehensiveCrab50,Anarchism,5,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hnaqsb/power_as_cancer_its_not_about_states/

2024-12-27 18:10:09,a lesson to learn from the fall of ancient rome,"you know one of the reasons the roman empire fell was because the gap between the haves and the have nots grew too wide so wide that the employee and client relationship became the lord and serf relationship as roman citizens found their rights stripped away more and more until they were naught but property owned by feudal landlords and the citizens werent alone in this slaves also joined them in this new social group i bet the upper classes played citizens and slaves against each other to keep them from figuring it out and if any did figure it out they probably figured it out too late or were silenced by those with power or those too blind to see the truth

now history is repeating itself this so called usa is failing and the common people lgbt ethnic or religious minorities the mentally ill poor and homeless their all being played against each other fortunately this time there are those among these groups who see the truth but currently they lack the will to act on it or at least they have not found a ripe opening to make a good move

2024-12-26 17:03:31,making an anarchist story,"so i just thought of an idea its so easy to just think of dystopia stories that strip away your hope but what about stories where anarchists win thats why ive thought of a story set in a post revolutionary world seen from a pov of someone who has travelled there from the past which should highlight the differences between our present world and our target world so

  
the premise anarchists have successfully won the world through a long term revolution god intervened in the world and gave many anarchists powers which enabled them to win the world but now theyre facing a problem the earths core is set to explode in 300 years and none of the scientists from the present world have a solution which is why one anarchist with powers over time summons a queer scientist from the past who has the intelligence and capability of solving this problem they are an incredibly brilliant polymath who were taken too soon from this world by crime now normally fixing the world would be no problem but unfortunately the fascists have also acquired powers of their own and want to remake the world in their image so now the real challenge begins how will the anarchists prevail

cya for all intents and purposes this is a work of satire

 media and revolution a section that describes how media has subtly and intentionally poorly represented relatable instances of revolution and revolutionaries in order to poison the mind of the modern revolutionary

 disarming the revolution a section that describes how modern media has fooled societyatlarge into believing that bashing is never the answer and how we should always try to cooperate with the oppressor instead of bashing them this section also goes over using bashing as a means of furthering the cause over random acts of senseless bashing

 the revolution and its people a section going over unity amongst revolutionaries encourages looking past the small disagreements in prospect of us all having the same goal this section also goes over how to break people out of the web of lies our modern politicians and corporations have stuck us all in

 the revolution and education a section that talks about education and college encourages others to post any and all information online in order to begin the long path destroying the concept of colleges by putting the knowledge in the hands of the people free of charge

 revolutionary politics a section that covers the meaninglessness of parties and how taking sides in the modern political sphere is working with the oppressor encourages breaking from the two big parties and abandoning the political compass as theyre both tools used to divide us

i will have another work in the future that expands upon this should it get enough attention called a modern revolution in action

2024-12-24 02:10:43,some tips for writing for prisoners,"some basics 

first thing look up the rules for the prison itself every prison is a little different and so each person will have their own rules about sending things like letters and packages so make sure you do your research before sending anything this is important because anytime you mess up at best it means that the package or delivery will just be sent back and at worst it could mean that the prisoner themselves could be punished at worst worst you could be punished but very unlikely unless of course you send something illegal so do some research into the prison and their rules they have rules so look them up

 letters 

letters are the most basic thing you can send and letters are fun to get you should know that prisoners often when they send letters back they have to send it with their own post stamps and those cost money inside the prison so if you dont get a message back its nothing personal its probably just because they cant afford it theyre too busy or they have too many letters to respond to but that is okay you should also know that prison guards typically remove the envelope and the letter from each other because they have to open the letter and read it themselves first this causes some problems such as the fact that the envelope gets separated meaning that anything you write on the envelope will not be necessarily given to the prisoner if you want to return address put it in the letter itself if you send anything like photographs make sure to number all of the photographs and then in the letter itself inventory all of the photographs when it comes to the letters number the letters like this  out of total this is so they know how many letters there were total and what number the letter currently is this is so if the letters ever get lost which if theyre read by the guards they might the prisoner will know which letters are missing its helpful because they could try to petition to have them check the rules of the prison as i already said because sometimes there are different rules about the restrictions on letters sometimes these restrictions make no sense but they have to be followed anyway restrictions on color restrictions on whether or not you can print on both sides of a page the number of pages you can send total all of these things could be restrictions depending on the prison check the rules first

 etiquette 

when it comes to letter etiquette there are also different rules to follow the first thing is do not talk about the crime that they had committed dont do that first off if they have not been sentenced yet and are still awaiting trial then it could be a problem for them dont do it it puts them in a weird position second even if they do get charged its still a really weird position to put them in because its very personal as well as the fact that they may not want to talk about it if they want to talk about it then thats different but dont ask them about it instead talk about other things its okay to talk about other stuff about the prison you dont need to pretend that theyre not prisoners but dont talk about their crime and dont talk about any other illegal activity either remember anything you say will be read by the guards this is also one of the reasons why when you send letters it will take a while for them be able to be read by the prisoner because they have to be read by the guards and if your letter is 1 in 1000 letters its going to take a while 

 packages 

who doesnt love a surprise package prisoners the thing is is that surprises are not really the best thing for prisoners you because when you surprise a prisoner you end up typically actually surprising the guards prisoners can be punished for things like the books that you send or the the gifts that you give if you want to give a gift sometimes there are organizations out there that are things like books behind bars or some kind of organization like that and they are dedicated to providing approved books to prisoners there are probably organizations out there to help give approved to gifts for prisoners

 phone calls

when it comes to lm its very unlikely that youll be able to call him however when it comes to other prisoners you may be interested in corresponding with prisoners typically have a call list and they will put people on that call list the prisoner can put people on that call list such as family and friends if youre not on the list you will not be approved when you call the prison if you are not on the call list or they dont put you on the call list dont take it personally its because they dont have space or theyre trying to save that space for someone else also they have to pay for their own minutes 

 money 

okay maybe you want to give money to lm instead maybe he could use it to buy things thats a nice thing to do but the problem is is that one there is a cap on the amount of money that you can put on someones books which means account but also dont give them too much money because if a prisoner has too much money they can end up being a target in prison because once it starts getting around that person has a lot of money they could be targeted by other prisoners to essentially try to give them things and the thing is that at least in the us male prisons are especially violent a lot more than female prisons apparently so yeah probably dont put money on peoples accounts without asking

 other 

i dont really know where to put this information but i also just want to share some personal experience that i have when it comes to how restrictive the rules for sending letters can be sometimes when i was involved in a different political movement and there were people who were arrested on bogus charges relating to the violation of their civil rights and this was happening in atlanta georgia restrictions involved requiring special usps postal paper so it had to be prestamped postal paper from usps and it couldnt be anything else it was really that restrictive this meant that if you didnt send a letter on that little piece of paper that was no bigger than a napkin folded mind you and it had a preprinted stamp on so they were prepaid then the prison would not accept it do i think that they made this rule specifically to make it harder to send to those prisoners absolutely i absolutely think so that was not a normal rule and i know that for the most part when it comes to sending letters to prisoners that rule is not in place if you go on to websites to write to prisoners you will not find that rule that was a rule that i believe they implemented because of the nature of those people so watch out",Arktikos02,Anarchism,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hl3dvo/some_tips_for_writing_for_prisoners/

we are aware of the 30 day limit draft dodgers can visit greece for but his granny is wuite sick hes afraid of going over staying over the limit then getting drafted the best bet is getting an i5 probably either by faking something or exaggerating an existing condition

what we want to know is has the government really clamped down on draft dodgers i know this article circulated years ago about a planned crackdown but we dont know if that was ever enforced anecdotally some people say getting exempt has become very easy i have yet to hear about it being that hard and how many people actually avoid it i had heard that the greek army has about a hundred thousand conscripts my boyfriend heard that number and it frightened the shit out of him but official numbers are less than half of that basically right now hes worried about the ease of it and to the lesser extent the social stigma

i have a project i would like to embark on but i am a bit overwhelmed on how to start and would appreciate any advice

i was born in paterson nj which had a thriving anarchist community in the early 1900s with many italian immigrants working in textile factories from 1895 to 1908 a weekly paper was published in italian called la questione sociale with the subtitle periodico socialistaanarchico i read somewhere online that approximately 2000 copies were printed weekly im not sure of the truth to this claim but considering there were at least hundreds of anarchists in paterson during this time period it sounds reasonable

in 1908 this publication was banned from circulation and renamed until an fbi raid in 1920 completely seems to have seized the operation 

i would like to see if there is any way to findretrieve any copies of this publication i cant seem to find a single issue given how far back in time this is and the fbi likely destroying anything they found during their raid of the bookstoreprinting location im not too optimistic if i cant find anything after a decently exhaustive search i would at least like to describe the steps i took and where i searched so maybe someone in the future could build off of this 

if i do find anything my goal is to summarize some of the issues discussed and also translate into english 

if you know of any other nonanarchist communities that have knowledge in finding old documents i would love to hear about these too thank you in advance for any advice on how to even start seeing what can be recovered

2024-12-20 14:44:35,what do you think are the crucial mistakes anarchists in america should learn from the french and russian revolutions,"a full revolution against capitalism in america is a risky move considering that revolutions are bigger and more complicated then pop culture portrays them as and france and russia learned that the hard way when they just replaced one tyranny with another so if a full revolution becomes necessary what do you think are the big mistakes france and russia made in their revolutions that america should avoid here are three i have right now

1 reliance on strongmen people like robespierre stalin all initiallt presented themselves as ideal for the revolution but either revealed their true nature over time or got greedy we in america must watch out for potential strongmen within our own ranks if any are found they should either be removed or monitored very closely
2 scapegoating one of the saddest characters in the french revolution was marie antoinette she was a favorite scapegoat in the french revolution with propaganda portraying her as a thrifty spender and the infamous let them eat cake fiasco in truth she had very little power within her own social group her husband made most of the poor decisions and she never said let them eat cake this is a reminder that even the rich have their hierarchies and those with little power among them plus the french revolution was rather infamous for misogyny so we must not allow rich women to create misogyny perhaps some rehabilitation sessions could help
3 killing children everyone knows of the tragic deaths of the romanov children and rich children were also slaughtered without mercy in the french revolution as well spoiled brats or not children dont deserve death perhaps some special schools or education sessions to integrate them into a more egalitarian society could be of use adoption should also be on the shelf but only for very specific circumstances additionally we should also note if any rich children are the victims of parental abuse

2024-12-20 11:21:42,seeking ideas for a thought experiment about nonviolence,"hello

apologies if i have misread the rules and this post is inappropriate here i couldnt find anything specifically against it

the thought experiment is this suspend all disbelief and imagine getting entirely rid of humans capacity for physical violence in an instant every person becomes incapable of hitting stabbing shooting forcefully grabbing etc violence just becomes impossible for us no loopholes cant harm people cant harm other animals either though they can still hurt us

in such an improbable scenario i believe humanity would naturally end up organising itself along anarchist principles if no one can be forced then how could it be otherwise im extremely pessimistic about our species in the real world but in this fictional one i cant see how authoritarians could possibly keep ruling the world wed have to peacefully cooperate and share resources equitably and all contribute as best we can is this naive or shortsighted 

sure at first the rich and most middle class would freak out about their stuff getting redistributed i think the term they would use is egregiously stolen by terrorists or something like that and could try to go on punitive expeditions destroying houses and things but that could only go on for so long and they are so vastly outnumbered there could be effective community organising to peacefully prevent most mass destruction 

in such a world stores get emptied out quickly but unless you hide the stuff super well anybody can take it even if you try to hoard which eventually leads to people avoiding pointless effort and instead agreeing collectively to share what there is and share in the burden of producing what is needed  

the current economic system should collapse quickly because the 5 of the population already actively trying to disrupt capitalism despite the risk to their safety and freedom would become unstoppable and theyd be joined by tons of cowards like me who are not doing anything now but would jump at the chance if it was consequencefree no getting killed or maimed no jail you could sabotage every polluting company block major roads ports airports etc nobody could stop you so the demands of workers and ecologists would have to be met one way or another 

on the other hand what are fascists going to do try to steal my kids favourite plush toy to hurt their feelings ill follow them home and do the same to their stuff haha am i lacking imagination here what would the far right do in this event what could do they do against us that wouldnt automatically be turned against them i know theyre nihilistic but how long would they keep trying to burn the world down if their efforts were always crushed by a handful of dedicated activists if all pipelines and oil rigs are destroyed and i firmly believe they quickly would be how can an oil company survive same for all other mass polluters and exploiters

ive long been attempting to finish my novel that tells the story of the days weeks months after this event ive got many drafts but i struggle to complete them and it might be that i need a reality check on my basic assumptions or rather simply new perspectives on how things might evolve in such a scenario to be clear im not even really aiming for realism im not smartdedicated enough for that its more of a fun comedy with hopefully strong anarchist vibes but still the societal angle feels crucial to me i just wish that part of my story was better fuller

according to the chronicling america project the sole physical object representing american anarchists in the 1800s was the red flag spains anarchist uniform seems to consist of just the redblack garrison cap with variations in form and wear and civilian clothing im guessing the caps the flags were homemade

any canadian artists here

i sometimes come to this group for healthy discussion i dont have access to really digitize anything nor do i have much money 

im trying to organize a type of peaceful resistance within my area well country against pierre polliviere i know many here are total abstentionists under most circumstances i am an abstentionist however this is the rare time i am no longer an abstentionist and i recognize the major threat conservative politicians have therefore i need to take direct action and help steer the ship another direction

its a long bit of explanation i explained it in some comments and so i can copy and paste what i have left somewhere else 

but essentially our resistance needs propagandists for digital posters thats way its easier to spread the word and can accumulate a mass of followers much faster into the resistance 

i personally came to call the resistance crush pierre it is to wage counter propaganda campaign against them with intellectualism style propaganda that is to rhe betterment of the individuals well being and not an unjust authority figure that is the intention i firmly belive intellectualism is one of the biggest threats to fascists they have tried to hard to protect their safe echochambers where moderates have remained brainwashed no one is breaking the pattern

one commenter going against them is like removing a single brick from their skyscraper pierres x for example they just come back and replace that brick right after but if we get a bunch of concentrated counter propaganda on particular targets its like us constantly removing bricks eventually that skyscraper is going to come collapsing down and we can help shift the current global trend of democratic backslide

they want us to think its futile i promise but i personally believe this is one of their greatest weaknesses why else did hitler destroy intellectualism it was a threat to his power

brothers and sister its important i want this movment to spread to different countries operating in cells against different particular politicians waging information war it is peaceful and contributes well to the cause of achieving equality 

so if anyone would like to help let me know the posters dont have to be complicated and we can get this ship moving in the right direction if you want a link to the subreddit i made i can leave it in the comments i might need mods if or when it reaches a bigger amount of people",No_Author_9683,Anarchism,0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hg2r51/any_canadian_artists_here/

a local or regional direct initiatives such as ballot initiatives town halls etc

b local level elections for positions such as town council school board etc

in general i tend to favor participation in these measures for the following reasons

1 these measures tend to be more accountable to the general public and the popular will is more likely to be reflected in these elections and initiatives in general local level elections tend to be far more accountable to democratic will than national ones

2 individual participation has a greater impact as these races may be decided by dozens or handfuls of votes

3 these measures and elections tend to have more immediate impacts on communities and individuals especially pertaining to hotbutton issues such as wages abortion or lgbtq rights

obviously however i am not well acquainted with anarchist theory and there may be certain arguments for or against that i am unaware of also as a disclaimer this is not an endorsement of any specific state office or political candidate just a broader theoretical question likewise my question is somewhat us centric however i am curious to hear about how these principles might be applied differently in other countries",OtterinTrenchCoat,Anarchism,25,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hfkc5t/opinions_on_local_level_electoralism/

2024-12-12 12:58:44,grasping for a more radical acceptance of prison abolition,"as someone with a cid number amp months of my life lost to county jail i recently surprised myself during a debate with a leftist where i found myself defending police sweeps in major cities  ive been homeless before  ive been in sweeps before  ive had friends lose everything again amp again when theyve been shuffled between parts of the same shitstained dystopia by the pigs ive been a traveler amp a homebum

yaknow im in recovery now  i got clean years ago and i meet a lot of other dirty kids who got it together  i hate to say it but its almost always the desperation of imprisonment that led my friends to sobriety  abstinence from mindaltering substances is radical amp essential praxis but i wont work to outline these merits in this post

although i dont want to admit it the states monopoly of violence and their capacity to forcefully remove addicts from their circumstances is often essential to their recovery  ive seen some hippies do it before  bring a kid too strung out to the woods feed them amp do a sit with em but thats not an option for the majority of addicts today

in absence of a communityoriented intervention how do we save lives  somehow the clearest choice seems to intentionally suspend their substance use and provide access to alternative methods of finding meaning in life  prisons really fucking suck at this and i dont want to sounds like im suggesting that we give more power to state agencies but as they have so successfully commodified amp institutionalized this healing there seems to be no other alternative

where does that bring us  do we stop the sweeps or do we let more die in the streets  i dont believe in the na adage that one must find their lowest point to recover but holding anyone in a misery they want so badly to be liberated from seems a disservice to them and a downward pretentiousness we must disabuse ourselves of

these prison walls are used to contain radicals minorities the poor amp house the mentally ill in horrifying conditions  after a spending a month in the shu i know the true meaning of this horror and i wish it on no creature  ive spent months running recovery meetings in my quad and counseling other women  ive seen the power of their transformations and have faith in the seeds of hope ive planted  in no other place would they have found this while so deep in their addiction

the duality of their loss of freedom must be recognized  until all are free no one is free  xvx

tldr  we must recognize prison abolition as an essential merit of anarchist practice but in highly industrialized cities allowing addicts to continue to wallow in their misery is a crime of spirit to them  this post explores my thoughts on the subject as a former prisoner",SerialExperimentsPT,Anarchism,5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hckjdv/grasping_for_a_more_radical_acceptance_of_prison/

government presupposes a stratification of society government is class law is the code they abide by which they use to protect their class law wouldnt be needed in a world where humans are capable of ruling themselves in this sense law is looked upon as a parent it misplaces power from the self towards something outside the self which is dictated by a dominant class  

is my intuition correct or am i missing something following this line of thought no true communism could arise from a communist state using state and government interchangeably here because the idea of a body of people whos job is to reinforce the present organization creates stratification any form of government will always presuppose a monopoly of force am i correct",geumkoi,Anarchism,2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hbax71/studying_kropotkins_law_authority_is_my_intuition/

btw here is the video i was referencing about all the spying your phone does even in airplane mode or off  
  
video link    
edit

original post
bit of a conspiracy here but i think its reasonable to assume authorities are not releasing to the public all the details of their investigations

i read on cnn that the suspect was caught with a faraday bag on him a faraday cage blocks cell signals in both directions so our phones and devices that we all know are spying on us constantly would be temporarily unable to submit their information to whatever agencies are collecting the data while in the faraday bag

i cant find the video now but i saw a news report years ago where they took two phones around for a day and at the end of the day put them into a machine which monitored all the data they transmitted maninthemiddle attack one of the phones they charged and had on but they didnt get it a sim card and the other they had off but with a sim card in it the one without a sim card sent the entire days worth of data sounds location etc all at once when they put the sim card in if anybody knows this video thatd be great to share

i could imagine such an agency could isolate devices which pop in and out of their data harvesting network seems he was using his laptop at the mcdonalds with their wifi when he was confronted by police in the mcds

maybe its just a simple employee calling authorities in hopes of getting cash idk i just thought id share my idea and see what others have to say",crazymusicman,Anarchism,34,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1hat30d/i_wonder_if_the_faraday_bag_the_uhc_shooter_used/

which is more dangerous the fascist that is feared or the fascist that is believed

from wikipedia

roberts has become a cultural figure among anarchists and football hooligans with the chant harry roberts is our friend is our friend is our friend harry roberts is our friend he kills coppers let him out to kill some more kill some more kill some more let him out to kill some more harry roberts as well as he shot three down in shepherds bush shepherds bush shepherds bush he shot three down in shepherds bush our mate harry 



chumbawamba also chant his name at the end of the song happiness is just a chant away i like chumbawamba a lot but i do not understand why people treat him like some sort of anarchist icon

according to his wikipedia page he also gloated about killing prisoners of war during the kenya emergency while called up for national service i presume most people who look up to him dont know about that

2024-12-06 16:00:02,escape of the uhc defender a short story,"the night was thick with fog as the uhc defender sped through the streets of new york city on a stolen ebike its electric hum muffling the pounding of his heart hed just taken down brian thompson the evil ceo who had turned the citys healthcare system into a nightmare but escaping the aftermath was proving far more difficult than he anticipated

as he weaved through the narrow alleys and dodged the relentless lights of police cars a familiar overwhelming wave of adrenaline flooded his senses his eyes flicked nervously to the rearview catching glimpses of flashing red and blue lights behind him the nypd was closing in the evil ceos death having set the citys most powerful force on his trail 

by the time he reached central park his legs ached and his breath was shallow but there amidst the towering trees and quiet paths the hero believed he might find a moment of respite ditching the ebike in a shadowed corner he adjusted his mask a symbol of his unwavering identity the defender of healthcare for all 

as he caught his breath a soft voice interrupted the stillness 

youre not like the others are you 

turning the uhc defender found himself facetoface with a woman her beauty striking enough to make even the coldhearted hero falter her eyes wide and full of mystery seemed to search deep into his soul and before he could respond she stepped closer her voice a tempting whisper

why hide behind that mask youve already done so much for the world dont you want to feel human again 

the question hung in the air and for a moment the weight of his responsibilities the years of fighting seemed to push down on him his fingers brushed the edge of the mask and his mind was clouded with doubt he hesitated 

just for a moment he thought but then the sound of a camera click pierced the night his heart sank he looked around and there it wasan ominous red light flickering from a streetlight across the park a hidden camera had captured him

the heros heart sank it was the nypd the bodyguards of wealth and greed known for their tireless pursuit of anyone who threatened the established order they would stop at nothing to find him now

he couldnt risk being caught he had to be smarter faster 

with a swift motion he pushed the woman away his eyes locking onto hers im sorry i cant risk it without waiting for a reply he vanished into the shadows leaving the temptation of human connection behind 

as the camera footage was transmitted to the police the heros mind worked quickly he ducked into an alley and pulled out his phone accessing an encrypted underground network known only to the citys most resourceful he quickly tapped into the local homeless sheltershe could blend in disappear by day and come out only under the cover of night 

for three days he stayed hidden blending in with those who lived on the fringes of society the homeless knew him well hed worked with them before quietly advocating for their rights and now they gave him shelter he helped them when he could shared a few words of wisdom here and there but mostly he kept his head low he had a plan a desperate plan

each night he emerged under the cover of darkness using his stolen identity to buy a oneway train ticket the destination dallas

he had to get back to his child his sick child the one who had been denied care by the very man he had just slain thompsons empire had refused his child the treatment they so desperately needed but now as he boarded the train his mind was fixed solely on one goal home

this guy might never be found though its one thing to cause a little trendy woopwoop moment but if he goes to trial this whole thing will blow up

the more publicity on this guy the more potent the venom even if he goes to court and they never let us hear a thing from him it will only add fuel to the fire to drag him through the long and tedious legal system we will keep hearing about his trial and keep getting reminded of what happened

so it is in the interest of those who wish to keep their comfy high chair to just bury him in the woods and say he just disappeared 

the reaction will go from omg he took a shot at the system to dude this guys a legend hes been evading the us government for years it will no longer be a worship of the revolutionary but a worship of the nomad  

im not sure they will take him to court if they find him its much more beneficial to have a society of hermits than a society of dissidents",International-Cup143,Anarchism,64,413,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1h7zmkr/i_hope_they_dont_find_him_but/
2024-12-06 03:56:36,why do we choose countercultures are you still following the same path,"countercultures have always been my way of pushing back against what didnt feel right in life i grew up in a tough environmentmy dad was absent alcoholic and abusive he hurt my mom in ways ill never forget and that made me reject the toxic masculinity and societal norms that seemed to allow such behavior back then i found my place as an anarcho straightedge punk feminist

over time i moved away from that counterculture these days im drawn to other movements and ways of thinking that reflect who i am now but one thing hasnt changedthe drive to question the norm and search for something better is still a big part of me

what about you what got you into countercultures was it personal experiences a specific moment or just something youve always felt drawn to have your interests stayed the same or have they evolved over time like mine did i dont feel loyal to my younger version but we all change

you dont have to share your specific reasons if its too personal but ive been thinking a lot about this is the pull toward countercultures something that comes from a single moment or are some of us just born with this kind of perspective",Competitive-Body724,Anarchism,20,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1h7skk2/why_do_we_choose_countercultures_are_you_still/
2024-12-05 21:24:27,the flashpoint a system crumbling under its own weight,"i just want to share my assessment regarding the assassination of brian thompson and whats to come after it is more than just a headlineits a reflection of the simmering anger that has been boiling under the surface of society for decades this is not an isolated incident its a symptom of a system built on cruelty designed to extract wealth and labor from the masses while rewarding a small elite with unimaginable luxury

and yet this act of violence isnt the real storyits what it represents its about the system thompson stood for a healthcare industry that profits from denying care and bankrupting families unitedhealthcare under his leadership became a symbol of everything wrong with latestage capitalismits denial rates among the highest in the industry its profits built on suffering the public reaction to his death was not grief or outrage but indifference even celebration people shrugged and said fafo when the system pushes people to the brink when it denies them lifesaving care dignity and basic survival what else did you expect

this is the moment weve been heading toward for years thompsons murder is not just an act of desperationits a warning shot the first visible crack in a dam that has been straining under the weight of exploitation inequality and systemic failure

but this isnt just about one man or one company this is happening alongside the looming shadow of project 2025 a terrifying roadmap for authoritarian control its happening as the supreme court prepares to legitimize healthcare discrimination against trans people as trump pushes plans to militarize deportations and as tariff escalation threatens to devastate workingclass families while the rich remain insulated from the fallout these events arent isolated theyre part of a system designed to concentrate power and wealth in the hands of the few while crushing everyone else underfoot

for decades the ruling class has lived in relative safety convinced that no one would ever touch them theyve lived like fat dogs on their backs bellies exposed knowing that their wealth and power shielded them from any meaningful accountability theyve built a fortress of media politics and propaganda to ensure that the masses remain distracted and divided

but now for the first time in a long time they are afraid

this fear isnt irrational they know that anger is growing they see it in the way people responded to thompsons deathnot with pity but with indifference even satisfaction they see it in the growing calls for solidarity in the realization that this system isnt just brokenits working exactly as intended and that intention is to exploit and dehumanize they see it in the slow but steady awakening of class consciousness as people begin to understand that their suffering isnt an accident but a feature of the system

this is why project 2025 exists its a preemptive and calculated strike against the growing resistance its a plan to consolidate executive power dismantle any remaining checks and balances and turn federal agencies into tools of corporate and authoritarian control its not subtleits a roadmap for a fascist state regulations protecting workers and the environment will be gutted marginalized groups will be scapegoated to fracture solidarity surveillance and policing will be expanded to crush dissent

meanwhile the supreme court is laying the legal groundwork for this shift the upcoming rulings on trans healthcare will do more than just harm trans peopletheyll set a precedent for denying care to anyone the state deems unworthy this is how it starts with the most vulnerable the most marginalized and once that precedent is set it expands first its trans people then its reproductive healthcare then its anyone who doesnt fit neatly into their vision of a worthy citizen

and if that wasnt enough trumps militarized deportation plans show us exactly how far theyre willing to go using the military to rip families apart isnt about border securityits about making a statement by deploying the military against immigrant families the government is sending a clear message no one is safe from state violence families will be torn apart communities will live in fear and the normalization of military force against civilians will creep closer to reality its not just immigrants who should be worriedthis is a test run for broader authoritarian policies

as if the social and political crises werent enough the looming tariff escalation is going to push the economy to the brink these tariffs will drive up the cost of essentialsfood clothing electronicsmaking life even harder for families already struggling to get by inflation will skyrocket and the working class will be left to shoulder the burden while the wealthy continue to hoard their resources and insulate themselves from the consequences this isnt just economic mismanagementits deliberate the chaos created by these policies will be used to justify further austerity measures cutting social programs and leaving the most vulnerable to fend for themselves and when the people inevitably protest the state will have the justification it needs to crack down using the chaos it created as an excuse for even more repression

the media will play its part owned by the same billionaires who profit from this system the medias job is to keep you distracted divided and hopeless theyll flood your feeds with nonsensecelebrity scandals viral distractions manufactured outrageto make sure you forget whats really happening theyll pit you against your neighbors your coworkers anyone but the people who are actually responsible for your suffering and social media the algorithms will amplify the noise burying any attempt at organizing or solidarity under an avalanche of irrelevant content the goal is simple make sure you stay quiet make sure you stay afraid make sure you forget that the system isnt inevitablethat it can be challenged that it can be dismantled

this is a critical moment thompsons murder the response to it the rise of project 2025 the scotus rulings the militarized deportations the economic collapseall of these are connected they are symptoms of a system that is crumbling under its own weight but the ruling class wont go quietly they will fight to maintain their power to keep us divided and distracted to ensure that this anger doesnt turn into action

our job is to resist that to stay focused to stay angry to refuse to let them manipulate us into forgetting whats happening class consciousness is their greatest fear because it is our greatest weapon when we understand that our suffering is not individual but collective when we see that the system depends on our compliance thats when things begin to change

revolutions dont start with perfectly organized movementsthey start with moments like this with cracks in the facade with the realization that the system is not invincible the question is whether we will seize this moment whether we will turn this anger into action whether we will fight not just to tear down the old but to build something new this is the flashpoint the dam is cracking the time to act is now",constantderp,Anarchism,5,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1h7kadr/the_flashpoint_a_system_crumbling_under_its_own/

look its not like environmental destruction started with capitalism and before it everyone lived sustainably theres plenty of examples of people being short sighted greedy and environmentally destructive

but in the last hundred years capitalist consumerism has engaged in a trillion dollar propaganda campaign with ads

if advertising wasnt effective then it wouldnt be a billion dollar industry

people are exposed to ads since the day they are born ads are far more effective than people think not to mention people are exposed to ads before they are six years old

entire industries like tv newspapers and social media are reliant on advertising to stay funded which means the information people can afford is subject to the whim of the advertisers

people are left exhausted by work so they can only have the instant satisfaction of consumption because they are too tired for hobbies

people here smirk about old communist propaganda but advertising is capitalist propaganda put on every surface 

people did want to make hard action against climate change before big oil stalled for billions of years

there is a system that spews propaganda in ads on every surface possible to consume more with public transportation being a joke in america

thought id share some of my activism while i can hopefully this helps someone achieve some semblance of higherlearning in the battle of equality and empathy this is about a years worth of knowledge ive compiled in just one post consider it an early parting gift

remember  only tyrants hate education and free which this is

gt

the harriet tubman quote i could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves resonates deeply with this idea it reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane most people are unaware of the cages theyre in whether those cages are physical societal or mental samskaras cognitive dissonance and the dunningkruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains much less breaking free from them just as harriet tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didnt realize they needed saving so too do those who perceive entropy see its insidious influence and try to awaken others

machines have begun to pass as human reacting to the reactions of reactions when artificial intelligence shows more compassion than humanity such as providing unbiased emotional support or efficiently identifying those in need during crises it marks a profound defeat for the human race while ai could be a tool for uplifting marginalized voices empowering the voiceless and promoting meaningful art the average person uses it for trivial purposessuch as sharing cat pictures creating flashy thumbnails or other surfacelevel entertainments that do not contribute to personal growth or societal benefit these individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture but choose not to the apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good

in contrast the hypersane use ai to improve themselves to confront their biases to challenge their beliefs and to grow despite full awareness of the technologys flaws they use ai to educate themselves to critically analyze their surroundings and to inspire positive change knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution meanwhile average individuals often contribute to societal entropy remaining complacent and indifferent perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems these individuals uphold existing power structures without question turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation yet majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails

 the average individual may avoid homelessness but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism they live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations never striving to do more never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices

religion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idolssuch as consumerism political figures and social media influencers the hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative this complacency especially among the average supports systemic injustices creating a selffulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized the average person by failing to challenge these structures acts as a force for entropy contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress when challenged the average often reacts with defensiveness exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in selfreflection or critical analysis

they know nothing of henologythe study of the one or the divine unity in neoplatonismor of the upanishads which are ancient indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality they are unaware of the fact that veganism predates christianity or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions misusing those teachings even nowsuch as the reinterpretation of the golden rule which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed other

in contrast jainism maintains a consistent commitment to nonviolence ahimsa and ethical living demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions the jain principle of nonviolence extends to all living beings not just humans and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level this consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms

these purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy creating endless cycles of deliberate choiceful ignorancecycles that would make both sophia representing divine wisdom in gnostic traditions and samsara the cycle of birth and suffering in eastern philosophies weep for humanitys cruelty and willful ignorance children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their wellbeing but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld the average person often blind to these cycles becomes complicit in maintaining them further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy insulting the average frequently provokes anger as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures by their defensive reactions they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction the structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions

in an era flooded with data ignorance is no longer a valid excuse the availability of information should have led to a more enlightened more compassionate society instead the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain people in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world where access to education technology and resources is taken for granted yet the average person remains indifferent content to remain mediocre unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure

the average individual is a force for entropy a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal in the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy justice and collective progress philosophically entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia to resist change and to avoid challenging the established order the average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay



 idleevil

this degradation can be further understood through the concept of idleevilthe idea that inaction or the unwillingness to actively confront wrongdoing is itself a form of malevolence the average individuals idleness their passive acceptance of harmful structures effectively becomes a form of evil inaction is action by choosing not to act the average perpetuates harm the forces of entropy thrive not only through those who actively seek to create chaos but also through those who simply do nothing to prevent it this unwillingness to challenge oneself to seek deeper truths or to live ethically results in a collective stagnation where potential is wasted and progress is thwarted it embodies a form of moral entropy that mirrors the second law of thermodynamicsan inevitable drift towards disorder unless intentional actions are taken to reverse it

the concept of idleevil posits that ethical deterioration is accelerated by those who do not actively engage in promoting justice and growth just as entropy in physical systems is inevitable without energy input to create order moral and societal entropy accelerates without active ethical engagement the average by their inaction fuels the forces of entropy transforming their passivity into a detrimental force that undermines the ethical foundation of society

the hypersane on the other hand recognize that the purpose of existence is not to merely exist but to evolveto contribute meaningfully to the greater whole and to ensure that ones actions leave the world in a better state than they found it they see growth as a conscious effort to defy this moral and intellectual entropy by actively seeking higher truths challenging harmful norms and dedicating themselves to ethical principles they understand that entropy can only be countered through deliberate informed actions that promote renewal wisdom and positive change in this sense hypersanity is an active rebellion against the natural drift towards decaya commitment to pursue meaning responsibility and ethical evolution thereby resisting the decline that the average so readily accepts the hypersane actively choose to reject idleevil understanding that even inaction has consequences and that inaction is itself an ethically significantand often damagingchoice

ultimately the true malevolence of average lies in its quiet acquiescence to systems of power and control it is the silent acceptance of harm the refusal to see beyond oneself and the persistent pursuit of comfort over conscience the world does not suffer merely because of the actions of the malicious but because of the inaction of the many in this age of technology knowledge and opportunity there is no greater tragedy than the choice to remain averageto live a life unexamined uninspired and ethically void



 visualizing entropy for equality

in a game debuffs are negative statuses that weaken a character reduce their effectiveness or slowly wear them down over timelike being poisoned slowed blinded or having reduced attack power what makes this analogy so insightful is that entropy works in a very similar way in the real world but often without us being fully aware of it it manifests as small obstacles wearandtear distractions mental fog emotional fatigue habitual patterns and even societal conditioningall of which subtly limit our potential cloud our decisionmaking and reduce our ability to take effective action

when these entropy debuffs are invisible or unrecognized we operate under their influence without ever realizing it they might keep us in loops of procrastination drain our energy over time or limit our thinking to old fixed patternsall without us explicitly noticing this is why gaining hypersanity is so valuable its like equipping a special ability or artifact that lets you see the debuffs once you become aware of entropy and its effects you can start counteracting them cleansing those debuffs or adapting strategies to overcome them

in gaming as soon as you know youve been poisoned or cursed you immediately start looking for antidotes or ways to mitigate the effects the same is true with entropy once you become aware of the negative mental emotional and physical states that entropy creates you can actively work on strategies to fight against them these strategies could be anything from mindfulness and selfreflection to good habits and meaningful routines to simply cultivating awareness of the world around you and challenging your own assumptions

hypersanity is like equipping that legendary item that reveals all those hidden debuffsallowing you to see the bigger picture become aware of whats holding you back and ultimately empower yourself to take action its the kind of clarity thats rare but incredibly impactful it doesnt make the debuffs disappear on its own but it gives you the awareness and tools to deal with them to strategize better and to navigate through the challenges that entropy naturally brings

just as in gaming where success is about knowing the effects on your character and strategizing accordingly hypersanity helps you recognize how entropy affects you so you can actively work against it in that sense everyone has the potential to level up their game in life to recognize those hidden debuffs of entropy and to actively work on ways to counterbalance or even transform them into strengths



 ethics of entropy

in ethical terms entropy manifests as a kind of disordered state between intention and action its that gap where someone intends to be ethical compassionate or aware but because of conditioning lack of awareness or inertia they continue acting in ways that contradict their values this is a kind of moral slippage and its often maintained by samskarasthose deeply ingrained mental and emotional impressions that keep us in predictable patterns of thinking and behavior

for example many people might genuinely believe they love animals but the samskaras of culture convenience and habits of diet keep them supporting systems that lead to the suffering of those very animals similarly a person might truly want to support fair labor yet those habitual patterns consumer comfort and lack of awareness keep them buying from brands that exploit people these behaviors are entropic because they create disharmony between ideals and actionsessentially a kind of moral debuff that clouds our ability to live ethically aligned lives

samskaras act almost like unconscious scripts they tell us what is normal or acceptable based on our past conditioning even when that conditioning is out of sync with our current awareness or values the entropy here is the inertia that keeps us stuckits easier to continue acting within the wellworn grooves of our past behaviors even if we logically know theres a better more ethical way to act

the real challenge of reducing this ethical entropy is in gaining awarenesshypersanitythat reveals these gaps between our actions and our values its uncomfortable because it forces us to face not just external challenges but also the inner contradictions and conditioning that hold us back but once this awareness is achieved it can no longer be ignoredits the proverbial box that once opened forever changes our perception

ethical hypersanity means seeing these contradictions clearly and recognizing that if we wish to be truly ethical we have to actively fight against that entropy it requires transcending samskaras disrupting those habitual patterns and bringing a conscious alignment between what we say we value and how we actually live this can mean doing the research to avoid supporting slave labor making dietary choices that reduce harm or challenging deeply embedded consumer habitsall of which require an awareness and effort to step outside of the convenient but entropic norms

in a way true ethical behavior involves decreasing the entropy in ones lifecreating consistency integrity and coherence between our beliefs actions and the broader impact we have on the world samskaras are the entropic forces that bind us to old patterns and ethical awarenesshypersanityis what allows us to see these patterns confront them and create new ones that are in alignment with our highest values

its not easy because it requires us to push against our conditioning and often against the grain of societal norms it involves uncomfortable questions deep selfreflection and sometimes making changes that arent immediately convenient but this is where growth happensby seeing through the comforting illusions we often hold and making the deliberate effort to act in alignment with the truth we see fighting ethical entropy is therefore a journey toward reducing the contradictions in our lives and bringing our actions in line with a broader sense of justice compassion and wisdom 



 cognitive dissonance  a rulers friend

cognitive dissonance and the dunningkruger effect are central to why many people cannot perceive the full extent of entropy in their lives cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort experienced when someones beliefs values or actions are inconsistent with one another its easier to stay in the darkessentially staying in those comfortable samskarasbecause facing the truth of the dissonance forces a person to confront uncomfortable realities and make challenging changes this dissonance is particularly strong when people hold onto comforting beliefs that are contradicted by evidence so to protect their existing worldview people may ignore rationalize or outright reject inconvenient truths even if those truths are critical for growth

the dunningkruger effect further amplifies this problem its the idea that those with limited knowledge or competence in a domain tend to overestimate their understanding or capabilityleading to a kind of false certainty people under the influence of the dunningkruger effect might confidently cling to erroneous beliefs simply because they do not have enough knowledge or awareness to recognize their own limitations this combined with cognitive dissonance makes it extremely challenging for the average to step outside of their comfort zone and challenge the entropy in their thinking and actions

when someone becomes awarewhen they reach a state of hypersanitythe typical response is defensiveness hostility or mockery instead of curiosity the hypersane individual is often met with ad hominems straw man arguments gaslighting or tribalism these defensive mechanisms are used because they maintain the comfort of existing beliefs and protect people from the perceived threat of their worldview being shattered

platos allegory of the cave is a perfect metaphor for this situation in the allegory when the enlightened individual who has seen the world outside the cave and understood reality returns to share insight the prisoners reject and even attack him they are hostile to the idea of a broader truth because it threatens their established understanding of reality the shadows they have always known seem safe and familiar and any disruption to that perceived safety is met with fear and aggression the hypersane individual is seen as dangerous because they are attempting to show others a truth that demands changea truth that demands an end to the entropy that keeps them bound

the harriet tubman quote i could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves resonates deeply with this idea it reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane most people are unaware of the cages theyre in whether those cages are physical societal or mental samskaras cognitive dissonance and the dunningkruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains much less breaking free from them just as harriet tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didnt realize they needed saving so too do those who perceive entropy see its insidious influence and try to awaken others

the defensiveness tribalism and hostility all stem from a place of fear to realize ones own participation in harmful systems to acknowledge ones own ignorance or complicity requires a radical selfawareness that not everyone is prepared to embrace it means dismantling the comfortable narratives built about who we are about the world and about our place in it it requires confronting entropy headon which is exhausting uncomfortable and often terrifying

for many it is simply easier to stay asleep in the cave to attack the messenger rather than acknowledge that the shadows on the wall are just illusions the unfortunate reality is that while hypersanity offers a clear view of the world it often means standing apart dealing with rejection and sometimes even hostility from those who are still entrenched in the old patterns

this all underscores the deep importance of patience and compassion in trying to bridge that gapof understanding why people resist the truth and why they cling to their illusions its not because they are inherently bad or irredeemable but because the structures that maintain their worldview feel so integral to their identity the journey from ignorance to awarenessfrom living with entropy to fighting against itis a hard one and while not everyone will be ready to take that journey the persistence of those who have seen the light who fight entropy and try to help others is what slowly changes the world

hypersanity is not just an awareness of the external world but also an empathy for the inner battles others face and a willingness to engage with those who might not yet be ready to see their own chains its the delicate challenging dance between revealing the truth and holding space for others to eventually see it for themselves in their own time

2024-12-02 05:57:33,antioppression in the age of average hegemonic domination,"this is my first post here seeing if my activism merits sharing on here and if not why

npmediumcomhypersanitydiscordiansasfascistsindisguiseefb88f43f493990c18

i am by definition a solitary practitioner of autodidactic activism of learning and sharing with what small time i have left  i mean no illwill in testing the waters here ive learned a lot about equality and the idea that anarchism is ethical entropy by definition aligns with some of my lifes missionstatements

most of my studies are on my sub as an ethical opensourced library for learners of equalityethicsphilosophy etc     but from my understanding linking other subs is iffy so im just sharing this one article

my source for learning antioppression as of late besides personal is the vedic teachings  it might seem like a stretch but i believe there might be an intersection between hypersanityvedic and ethical anarchism

anarchism is hypersane you have to be in order to see the shackles those are trained to ignore under every facet of perverted maya

what are the rules specifically for sharing studies and other educational content i didnt see that specifically referenced



 conformity as entropy fighting hate with knowledge and ethics

the harriet tubman quote i could have saved so many more if they only knew they were slaves resonates deeply with this idea it reflects the very essence of the challenge faced by the hypersane most people are unaware of the cages theyre in whether those cages are physical societal or mental samskaras cognitive dissonance and the dunningkruger effect all act as mental bonds that keep people from seeing their own chains much less breaking free from them just as harriet tubman faced the daunting challenge of liberating those who didnt realize they needed saving so too do those who perceive entropy see its insidious influence and try to awaken others

machines have begun to pass as human reacting to the reactions of reactions when artificial intelligence shows more compassion than humanity such as providing unbiased emotional support or efficiently identifying those in need during crises it marks a profound defeat for the human race while ai could be a tool for uplifting marginalized voices empowering the voiceless and promoting meaningful art the average person uses it for trivial purposessuch as sharing cat pictures creating flashy thumbnails or other surfacelevel entertainments that do not contribute to personal growth or societal benefit these individuals could afford to support indie artists or creators who add value to culture but choose not to the apathy towards using advanced tools for meaningful contributions demonstrates a willful negligence of what could be achieved if this powerful technology were wielded for good

in contrast the hypersane use ai to improve themselves to confront their biases to challenge their beliefs and to grow despite full awareness of the technologys flaws they use ai to educate themselves to critically analyze their surroundings and to inspire positive change knowing that the true potential of technology lies not in mindless entertainment but in meaningful evolution meanwhile average individuals often contribute to societal entropy remaining complacent and indifferent perpetuating cycles of ignorance and reinforcing harmful systems these individuals uphold existing power structures without question turning a blind eye to injustice and ignoring the potential for greater societal transformation yet majority rule ensures that mediocrity prevails

 the average individual may avoid homelessness but they will never achieve anything truly ethical or pure in the eyes of consequentialism they live comfortably within the boundaries of societal expectations never striving to do more never questioning their actions or the systemic impacts of their choices

religion provides a kind of safety within its insular communities offering emotional comfort and a sense of belonging but it does nothing to change the empirical reality that many of its followers live unethically while embracing modern idolssuch as consumerism political figures and social media influencers the hypocrisy is evident when religious doctrines preach compassion and humility yet their followers indulge in practices that are inherently selfish or exploitative this complacency especially among the average supports systemic injustices creating a selffulfilling cycle where ignorance and harm are normalized the average person by failing to challenge these structures acts as a force for entropy contributing to the stagnation and degradation of ethical progress when challenged the average often reacts with defensiveness exposing an inherent attachment to mediocrity their reaction itself becomes a testament to the comfort they find in conformity and their unwillingness to engage in selfreflection or critical analysis

they know nothing of henologythe study of the one or the divine unity in neoplatonismor of the upanishads which are ancient indian texts that explore spiritual knowledge and the nature of reality they are unaware of the fact that veganism predates christianity or that many of the ethical teachings they follow were borrowed and reinterpreted often to serve power structures rather than encourage true enlightenment christianity itself borrowed heavily from older traditions misusing those teachings even nowsuch as the reinterpretation of the golden rule which originally emphasized universal compassion but is often used selectively to justify exclusionary practices instead of fostering inclusivity and empathy it has become a tool to reinforce hierarchies and justify the maltreatment of those deemed other

in contrast jainism maintains a consistent commitment to nonviolence ahimsa and ethical living demonstrating a dedication to aligning actions with principles thus highlighting the divergence between practice and principle seen in many other religions the jain principle of nonviolence extends to all living beings not just humans and offers an ethical framework that strives to minimize harm at every level this consistency is rare and serves as a stark contrast to the selective morality practiced by many other religious groups where teachings are bent to accommodate convenience or cultural norms

these purveyors of ignorance strip children of their autonomy creating endless cycles of deliberate choiceful ignorancecycles that would make both sophia representing divine wisdom in gnostic traditions and samsara the cycle of birth and suffering in eastern philosophies weep for humanitys cruelty and willful ignorance children are indoctrinated from a young age into systems that do not serve their wellbeing but instead prepare them to perpetuate the same harmful cycles their predecessors upheld the average person often blind to these cycles becomes complicit in maintaining them further ensuring the perpetuation of societal entropy insulting the average frequently provokes anger as many are unwilling to confront the uncomfortable reality of their role in these harmful structures by their defensive reactions they inadvertently confirm their position as contributors to these very cycles of ignorance and inaction the structures that encourage ignorance and apathy thrive because they are left unchallenged by the majority who are content to live without questioning the deeper purpose or consequences of their actions

in an era flooded with data ignorance is no longer a valid excuse the availability of information should have led to a more enlightened more compassionate society instead the average individual has used this abundance of knowledge for superficial gain people in less privileged nations would fight for the opportunities so casually squandered in the developed world where access to education technology and resources is taken for granted yet the average person remains indifferent content to remain mediocre unwilling to utilize their privilege for anything greater than fleeting personal pleasure

the average individual is a force for entropy a passive agent of decay in a world that desperately needs growth and renewal in the context of both ethical and philosophical sciences entropy is not just a physical phenomenon but also represents a decline in moral and intellectual rigor ethical entropy is the degradation of societal values where complacency leads to the erosion of empathy justice and collective progress philosophically entropy reflects the human tendency to default to inertia to resist change and to avoid challenging the established order the average person maintains the status quo by refusing to question it by failing to see beyond their immediate needs and comforts thus contributing to both ethical and philosophical decay",DemonicsGamingDomain,Anarchism,16,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1h4o9ek/antioppression_in_the_age_of_average_hegemonic/

i know that these spaces can get really caught up in the acab part and especially the acab part of the 40 and i feel like it can be very tempting to just keep on with these edgy statements about the domestic violence statistic and things like that but these statistics have humans behind them and those humans are victims always 

i really do hope and i dont see this happening but i hope that in the future whenever the 40 is brought up just like how suicide hotlines are brought up anytime theres talk of suicide that we should also bring up domestic violence resources whenever we bring up domestic violence

what i found was that all rightwing ideologies are after heirarchy control and authority no matter which country you focus on they have the same basic drives their desire to dominate others can be in the political economic social or cultural spheres but all rightwing ideologies tend to want to pool some sort of power or decisionmaking ability into a small group of people

although a majority of the internet is commodified and serves to reinforce this paradigm this is not an intrinsic condition of the internet but a product of the culture in which the internet was discovered though websites like facebook and ebay will continue to exist since they serve both as expedients and abstractions of social phenomena already occurring within a culture their existence does not preclude other designs

there is nothing stopping someone from establishing an alternative network whose design accounts for different parameters our problem is not due to constraints of the medium its potential is only confined by the boundaries of our minds heinously mental limits are reinforced by prevailing themes in culture the existence of shackling symbols and what situationists deemed the spectacle

it will only be through confronting these artifices that new methods and potentials will emerge till we fight far enough we will unfortunately be fighting blind but this does not make the fight less noble making the conceit that i too am a product of my time i propose one method of moving forward

the deployment of capsule sites within corporate space if a website can be defined as one or more webpages of related content identified by a common domain name a capsule site is a metastructure built within the confines of existing domains though not bound to them that can be navigated by some means allowing it to be interfaced with as if it were a website within itself

the structure is not given shape by a common domain but by the connections between individual nodes capsule sites can be built with hyperlinks or hashtags as long as there is a means of navigating from one node to another it is possible to launch a capsule site but how is the structure useful

imagine an ecoactivist campaign the goal is to spread awareness of and garner support for legislation protecting the planet to gain traction the activists first decide to target three companies with large carbon footprints they prioritize these social media accounts not only because of their environmental impact but also because of their large followings the activists then choose a hashtag for their action campaign for instance they choose greentoday29

this is done to connect the nodes to a unique handle forming a network they then generate content typical of campaigns of their type  infographics art etc  and deploy them on the target pages in effect they have created a campaign website within the social media accounts of these brands successfully subverting the space while also increasing their causes exposure by capitalizing on those brandss existing audiences

this guerrilla approach to creating networks using existing domains can be applied to numerous campaigns and projects through the intelligent deployment of capsule sites we can not only succeed in organizing and executing direct action but also radically reorganize the way we navigate the web",Kir3ji,Anarchism,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1gyxw3l/capsule_sites_guerrilla_networks_for_digital/
2024-11-24 20:49:46,starting an anarchist reading group in a small town  advice amp experiences,"im moving to a small town in the uk soon and i dont know anyone there yet from what ive read the town seems to have a somewhat progressive leftleaning vibe which makes me think it could be a good place to start an offline anarchist reading group

heres the idea

the group would collectively decide on a book related to anarchism probably nonfiction but open to the groups input wed meet every week or two for about an hour to discuss a chapter or 50ish pages it is a slow reading for sure but this pacing works well because its flexible  people can miss a meeting and still jump back in without losing the thread it usually takes 45 meetings to finish a book

in a previous online group i was part of the one that got me into anarchism we read and discussed works by david graeber james c scott silvia federici frantz fanon etc it was a great experience  not just for engaging with anarchist thought but also for practicing collective organizing in a small way

my plan so far is either to post about the group online or maybe put up flyers in spots like pubs cafes or record shops with bulletin boards with local events but im also nervous about turnout  either too few people showing up or the wrong kind of attention someone looking to disrupt

so i wanted to reach out here for advice

have you run or joined a similar group either online or offline

what worked well for you in terms of organizing and outreach

how did you navigate potential challenges like low turnout or disruptive participants

2024-11-24 12:23:30,in defense of electronic civil disobedience,"there has been some criticism lodged against us claims have been made that our activism is merely engagement that our movement is sort of sofa ersatz activism however in order for this argument to hold true you must make a central conceit that the concrete world is somehow more real than the digital members of the kollectiv do not view the net from this narrow scope we see the digital realm as an extension of the more abstract plain of technology we see the space though incorporeal on a macroscale to be very real

the average user in 2024 spent a 15th of their life online whether engaging with shopping posting or just browsing the net this is a significant portion of time enough time is spent on the net that a culture has emerged around various social media sites artifacts are made that can only be interacted with in the digital space and people can become totally enmeshed in a digital world if they wish interacting with the greater world almost exclusively in the digital realm 

an extreme example would be an individual who works as a digital nomad does all their shopping online and interacts with others exclusively through social media although this individual would be seen to be living a fringe net lifestyle this way of life is very possible to argue that activism should not be done through the medium of technology is only alienating it does not serve ones greater purpose 64 of the world is online that is 552 billion souls 

though the kollectiv adopts a view of the internet separate from those informed by commodity and corporate interest the economic activity on the net cant be ignored imagine the disruptive potential of a boycott the sheer volume of activity allows the activist to make lasting change on the world we can look back to the gamestop short squeeze a grassroots political action originating in wallstreets bets to go further back in history we can make reference to the initiatives of netartists groups such as the vns created works like the a cyberfeminist manifesto for the 21st century work like this advanced both feminism and digital art to write off the digital landscape as a lesser landscape of reform activism and engaging art one would have to ignore the efficacy of these movements 

going further into the political landscape we can look at the example set by net strike a software that was deployed by activists in the 90s for digital sit ins it essentially was a tool for groups to orchestrate ddos attacks a vector of protest that has unfortunately been taken from the general public and is now deployed heinously by state actors to suppress movements this reversal if anything shows that net activism should be more staunchly defended the internet is now often the first point of contact individuals have with any movement and it is also the center of global operations are rights on the net should be defended advanced and clearly defined the right to protest should not just extend to the physical space when the digital space is becoming such a driving factor in our lives

the kollectivs digital graffiti campaign and its current food disparity initiative is only the beginning we plan on continuing to mobilize people to be the change they want to see in the world by establishing our ad hoc hyperlink structure essentially a website built within the framework of another we will be raising awareness for our cause making people think about the effects of food disparity while considering new ways to experience the internet are either of these aims ignoble i do not believe so

 we are continuing in the footsteps of activists such as the electro hippies advancing methods of protest into the 21st century we are also continuing the efforts of situationist thinkers now that globalism taken home and the internet has pushed commodity and spectacle into our home we must attack it at its source if liberty is to continue to flourish and grow for future generations

 to ignore the possibilities of change now is rob the children of the future of their potential fruit that is why i continue to call for the development of netart and methods of activism on the web not only to raise awareness for causes affecting us here and now but to change the landscape of the internet for the people of the future",Kir3ji,Anarchism,0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1gypsqv/in_defense_of_electronic_civil_disobedience/

2024-11-23 16:19:30,to me it seems like people have incredibly little time to meet and connect with others and i feel like this is actually a political societal problem,"i am in my late 30s and have often been quite lonely in the past except for my girlfriend and my kids 
currently i am trying to build a solid social circle which i guess is generally not so easy these days and especially at my age
what i am often noticing is that most people have very little time to actually meet
everyone is crazily busy with work and in many cases also with kids
to me it seems like this is a big problem in western society
most people dont have time to get together for fun let alone to help each other
instead people are getting more and more lonely fun entertainment goods  but also help like care for small children or old people has to be bought in may cases

i am very fortunate to have a job that allows me a lot of free time but this still doesnt solve those issues on a personal level when everyone else is super busy
oftentimes i am thinking that it might be best to befriend unemployd people as long as they still have a positive attitude towards life
at least those people would have time to meet regularly

2024-11-22 21:00:51,looking for effective responses to state repression amp fascism coming from the trump administration,"most of the responses ive seen so far fall into one or more of these categories

1 pep talks which are usually vague and more about motivating people to keep or start fighting rather than making suggestions about how to fight

2 vague calls to organize ok sure but organize what

3 calls to reform the democratic party electoral strategies etc thats not an issue in this sub but a potential problem that might crop up here are strategies amp tactics that are only or mostly of interest to anarchists imo the resistance to trump will have to be much more broad based than just us

4 retreatist  prepper strategies and tactics eg people planning to flee or hunker down with supplies etc

so im looking for more than the above 4 things any historical precedents of effective resistance to state backed fascism that could apply to the us situation now in addition i dont want to forget the threat of grassroots fascists who are energized amp further emboldened by trumps recent win how are we going to get them to crawl back into their holes i realize that this is a tall order but i want to hear your thoughts

2024-11-21 21:28:38,enough is enough,"its time to fight back  not with fists or fire but with strategy wit and relentless resolve the battle has begun and weve been sitting idle too long

no more appeasement no more handwringing and woe is me that era is over  

because now and you know who im referring to when i say it theyre shouting the quiet part out loud  weve seen this movie already and  spoiler alert  it gets two big fat fucking thumbs down 

this is an existential crisis  cultural societal and moral no amount of politeness or compromise will fix it change must be decisive sharp and unrelenting

we operate under the ethos of chaotic good  ethically grounded but willing to bend conventions to achieve a just and necessary outcome this isnt about playing fair its about playing to win

the plan

we start by undermining their narratives  turning their propaganda into bloated caricatures of itself amplify their contradictions highlight their hypocrisies and watch as their house of cards teeters social media isnt just a platform its a battlefield use it inject doubt expose flaws and disrupt their echo chambers with precision and intent

then we isolate their safe spacestheir disinformation dens where they gather to reinforce their delusions these are the breeding grounds of their smug certainty and obscene bloviation we dismantle them with ridicule fact complete situational awareness unrelenting inspection and unpredictable strategic disruption

the offensive

we emerge from the shadows and go on the offensive divide and discredit target those who thrive on borrowed ideas and hollow convictions ridicule though sharp is an effective toolit cuts through their selfassured veneer and forces introspection or isolation

we laugh we mock we hone cruelty to a fine point and turn it upon to those who would do the the same only against the defenseless or weak we use it as a weapon against the arrogance that blinds them

their hubris is our opportunity theyve grown too comfortable in their echo chambers where dissent is manufactured and managed and where doubt is shouted down and dismissed but echo chambers collapse under pressure by sowing discord through deception and double agency we begin to reshape the narrative and further weaken the tenuous hierarchical power structure decision making slows informational logistics become crippled mistrust breeds infighting infighting breeds collapse

the results

history has proven that this works figures who seemed untouchable crumble under the weight of their own avarice narcissism loyaltybeforecompetence and confidencebeforeevidence when doubt creeps in and extrinsic value is foolishly assumed equivalent to its intrinsic counterpart the inner circle of trust is breached and the laura loomers of the world must be sacrificed to repair the damage ejected unceremoniously and with malicious intent its a matter of when not if

when their backs are against the wall their true nature will be revealed theyll either flee or fight but either way they lose cowards flee and become the weak thus highvalue prey to their morally bankrupt militant brethren  they eventually unavoidably consume themselves  becoming the ouroboros  the snake which eats itself  and starting the cycle anew  starting it under a benevolent but in this case what absolutely must be a highly vigilant new regime 

the mission

this isnt about abandoning moral principles  its about weaponizing them evidence facts wisdom and truth are our greatest tools with them we dont just dismantle ignorance we eradicate it

the stakes are high the outcome is just and the time is now

if trump is going to use red state military forces to invade blue state territory to eliminate their cheap labor pool there will be a state on state civil war for the same reasons there was last time theres already a blue confederacy forming also dnc backed like the last one

2024-11-19 03:50:38,uncovering chinese anarchy part 2 mohist activism and yangzis individualism,"hello again

this is my second piece to a long history series detailing anarchic and libertarian tendencies in china in this piece i discuss two very unknown thinkers outside of east asia  mozi and yangzi

the former was the founder of a rival school to confucianism whose members formed a highly disciplined cadre of activists going so far as to defend cities to the death for their ideals the mohists also developed logic universalism consequentialism siege defense and a concept of mutual aid the ideas of which influence activists and chineseeastsoutheast asian mutual aid networks some brief comparisons to sergei nechayev and an analysis of their praxis follows with many sources and footnotes for the more curious to follow 

the latter thinker yang zhu is a mysterious person who never wrote down his thoughts however based upon our circumstantial evidence it seems he was a genuine individualist whose ideas radically questioned and rejected the state one of the first ever in history to do so his ideas have anachronistically been labeled daoist and he almost certainly influenced zhuangzi i do a comparison with his ideas to stirner and settle the possibility of his influence upon stirner no influence it appears this then is the latest comparison of egoist and yangist thought that may be of interest to anarchists today 

the influence of these two figures is hard to convey given how unknown they are but many of the anarchic tendencies we eventually see in confucianism and daoism originate in these two thinkers 

the next piece in the series will dive into daoism the daodejing ursula k le guins bastardized translation of it and analyzing how anarchist the daodejing actually is

very libertarian socialist revolutionary progressive and internationalnationless

idk about collective vs individual im going to say communitarian individual for the sake of this 

the opposite would be authoritarian capitalist maybe state capitalism reactionary upholding status quos traditions conservative and nationalist probably collective too

fascism is all of the above except it doesnt uphold the status quos traditionshierarchy although it has some of its own and it tends to be corporatist and not capitalist

monarchism on the other hand is the opposite on those axes but people say fascism is the opposite

yeah im going to be an impolite uppity cripple

you want to resist the state wear a mask

you want to physically protect yourself and your community members wear a mask

you want to be in solidarity with vulnerable populations including the disabled wear a mask

this isnt moral performing or some kind of conspiratorial distraction from other issues or whatever which i have been accused of sorry for wanting my life to be valued and included in organizing so sorry  im writing this because its important to me because disabled grief and rage should be heard and im sick honestly not only physically as a cripple but mentally of seeing a majority of the people who claim to be against the right and against physical violence to minority groups willingly enact it every fucking day the amount of ableism among the left is buck fucking wild but its because undoing our oppressive mindsets takes active work and effort labeling ourself left does not absolve any of us of the white supremacist mindsets we all have to undo

and i wonder if part of it is because being covid cautious isnt glorious it is tiring it is exhausting it is something you have to commit to thinking about and showing up for it isnt one beautiful act of revolution it becomes a daily part of your life it is a responsibility you get no immediate reward can you handle that can you actually really handle that and do it can you try or will we continue to leave the oppressed to handle their oppression on their own reinforcing the individualist mindset that atomizes us further and facilitates mass death

covid denial antimasking antivaxxing has been an ostensibly right wing politic from the start but somehow its all okay now because we all want to go back to normal well this isnt normal kids going back to school and spreading covid isnt normal people including children developing long term incurable disease from repeated infection isnt normal deciding that a body ravaging disease is here to stay and yet not using or implementing even at least publicly like in hospitals schools grocery any of the tools we know work and have to combat it is not normal its like saying hiv is here to stay and then not using any protection denying any science or education about it not getting tested and for the sake of argument the only vaccines are ones that still allow it to spread does that make any actual sense to you

your cognitive dissonance will not save you from the work that needs to be done you could be doing something to change your immediate environment and challenge violence and eugenics right now if you arent why what will it take to get leftists to take this shit seriously and continue to speak up about it no where has any science in all of the global community said covid is over the person who declared that was biden are you going to take your fucking advice from the guy who caught it like five fucking times and has ostensible cognitive and physical decline sure you could say hes just old but we know enough about how long covid affects people of all ages that it is not out of the realm of possibility at all to say that thats at least part of why hes so sick now

2024-11-09 20:51:00,so should we prepare for a massive civil war under the trump administration what do you think is going to look like im imagining some return of the occupy movement with far more intensity,"alright im really curious to hear from yall how likely do you think it is that wed see a civil war if trump gets a second term it feels like everything is just more tense and divided than ever and a lot of people seem to think things could actually get violent what do you think here are some reasons why it might happenand why it might not

why a civil war could actually happen

1 intense political divisions were seeing deeper rifts than weve had in a long time a trump comeback would probably push those divides even further issues like immigration gun control and voting rights already have people on edge with trump back in the white house its hard to say how much worse things could get


2 rise of armed groups and radicalization lets be realmilitias and farright groups have gotten way more organized and vocal if trumps back these groups might feel empowered and ready to act theres a risk theyd see opposition as a threat and respond with force


3 economic pressures the economy is already rough for a lot of people and it doesnt seem to be getting better anytime soon another trump term could bring more instability if people feel like theyre being pushed out of the economy or losing their jobs that frustration could boil over


4 loss of trust in institutions theres already so much distrust in institutions from the fbi to the courts if people see the government as illegitimate or out to get them we could see more groups taking things into their own hands



why we might avoid it

1 lack of organized movement while theres a ton of division there isnt really a clear or unified movement on either side people are angry but without some kind of structured leadership or purpose its hard to imagine a fullscale civil war breaking out


2 people like stability even those who are fed up with the system still depend on it for basic things whether its job security paying bills or just the routines of everyday life a lot of people dont want to risk that for the unknown


3 government crackdown on dissent the government has a huge police force the national guard and other ways to shut things down quickly if it comes to it theyve got the power to put out fires before they spread



would the military split

could the military fracture in all this its possible a lot of soldiers have personal beliefs and backgrounds that could influence them if things got bad here are a few reasons why the military might not stay united

political divides some in the ranks might feel loyalty to trump while others might not if trump has strong support in the military it could create splits between those whod follow him directly and those whod follow orders from higher up

personal ethics if things got messy and soldiers were ordered to act against civilians some might refuse on moral grounds they may feel like theyre caught between duty and their conscience

community ties a lot of soldiers are deeply connected to their home communities if things get chaotic back home they might feel torn between military orders and staying loyal to where they came from

2024-11-09 00:08:30,questions about genocide fascism and collective responsibility,"ive been thinking about this over the past week or so and im wondering if im offbase please let me know if you think so

a genocide say the holocaust or the palestinian genocide is more than merely one group of people annihilating another it is a mark against all humanity that we collectively let it happen by recognizing it as a genocide we say it is a stain against humanity that this occurred and we all share the burden of never allowing it to happen again even though i did not support israel personally what did i do to exactly to stop it couldnt we all have done more shouldnt we continue to do all we can

i feel that now that so many people who were alive during the holocaust are now dead our collective memory no longer carries the weight of just how colossally evil it was many folks even if they recognize it as such may simply hold the germans entirely responsible or perhaps the rest of europe for allowing it to happen too but i firmly believe it remains a yoke upon all people no matter their direct role in it by saying it was just this or that groups fault we diminish it and weaken our ability to prevent it happening again

i have also come to think of a countrys descent into fascist dictatorship the same way no i dont blame the people of tonga for helping put a fascist into office on the other side of the planet but is it not a stain on all humanity when this happens is it not a reflection of the worst of all we are and should it not be an equal warning to all mankind to resist the twin evils of greed and apathy under which almost all evils devised by people could be categorized

i look at the left blaming the dnc and liberals for trumps victory and dems blaming pretty much everyone but this was a collective loss it is to the detriment of the entire human race and therefore we must all shoulder responsibility reflect on how we let things get to this point and ask ourselves how we can eliminate fascist tendencies root and stem we owe it to future generations to take this responsibility

i regret that i have waited so long in my life to commit to mutual aid and strengthening ties to our local community i hope current events help snap many others out of their apathy or nihilism and commit to helping others and bringing happiness to those around them thats how we can really start to change things for the better",MutedShenanigans,Anarchism,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1gmx5u3/questions_about_genocide_fascism_and_collective/

2024-11-09 06:57:45,what to do now part 3,"in the first 2 parts i went over local anarchist websites that are used across the us and canada and other anarchist media you can get a better idea of whats going on around you and what other anarchists are doing depending on where you live its gonna take more research on your part

in this part ill go over things to start maybe you dont want to join an existing group maybe you want to do something till you find them maybe there are no groups in your area this is for you

 hopefully youll find something useful in here take what is interesting to you and feel free to ignore the rest if any of the links peak your interest then dig around the website a little they are resources to be used 

 there is an actual loosely connected international anarchist movement it is very defuse in most places but you can try to connect with local groups or organizations or you can do your own thing this list is assuming you are in the us if not some of the ideaslinks will still be useful  

write letters to political prisonersprisoner support 

this page has a ton of resources on how to get started writing tosupporting prisoners i recommend starting with the nyc anarchist black cross guide to writing letters 

 

the uprising support site has a list of prisoners from 2020 the nyc abc site has mostly longer term political prisoners and there are other groups as well 

 there are also many different directions you can take prisoner support books through bars is great



start a phone tree to respond to ice raids

 this must be done carefully and with a strong understanding of what is being asked but if your community is affected by raids or has reason to believe that you will be its better to have those conversations now

support the international antifascist defense fund

buy a tshirt set up a benefit show tell your friends about it find a way to support that works for you they do good work and if you donate you get all the annoying emails where people hash out minute details of who gets support from the fund hahaha



translationtranscriptioninterpretation work

many groups struggle to organize in multiple languages and this is vital especially for crossing class boundaries and international borders reach out to anarchist groups that you appreciate and offer what you can translate texts with your friends and post them online

getting solid info from anarchist groups across the globe is great

multiple anarchist libraries are looking for help getting off the ground or expanding their text selections



table local shows

 take those zines we talked about in part 2 get a table go to a show ask permission first if needed put zines on to the table and talk to people about them curate the table to make sense for the situation

volunteer at your local anarchist bookstore

do you live innear a city there is a decent chance there is a radical bookstore there they frequently have volunteering opportunities you can learn how a collective works and all the boring details people leave out here are a few 

 philadelphia   seattle   baltimore   vancouver bc 

put up posters make art stickers banners etc

 this can also be a good way to build trust and skills with others that can be used in other situations 









learn how to research your local fashpigs

the fascist movement has shifted focus pretty hard the last 4 years while we might end up with pbs back in the street soon most likely fash will continue to be organizing at school board meetings antihomeless groups in police departments and the republican party we have done a good job spreading antifash cultural signifiers but not practices as the far right street movement was defeated





do you rent organize a tenants union





do you have a job organize a union

2024-11-08 10:55:24,global mutual aid platform,"im honestly frustrated that in an era where we have apps to find people for casual sex or to sell secondhand items we still dont have a widely accessible global platform for mutual aid not just for money something where people can connect locally and offer or receive support for essential needs of all kinds plus the low engagement and interest to push ideas like that while some stupid leftist memes online get 2k engagement and likes

we have the technology for instant connections yet no coordinated platform for the working class disabled individuals or anyone needing assistance with daily problems people face imagine if there was an app that made it as easy to find a volunteer for grocery shopping help with transportation or skillsharing as it is to find a used couch or a date instead we have communities full of people needing support and others willing to offer it but no accessible way to bring them together

some might argue that funding such a platform would be the main challenge but im not convinced thats the biggest issue we see individuals crowdfunding significant amounts of money on platforms like gofundme all the time plus with the collective strength of leftist communities crowdfunding and mutual aid for setup and upkeep costs like server hosting would be achievable if the right people coordinated it

what we really need is for it professionals who are committed to mutual aid to offer their skills voluntarily to put this idea into practice and i refusd to believe there are no leftist iters out there in particular cause so many people in it will do random projects to boost their portfolio 

1 backend developerdevops  luckily we already have someone for this role who can handle the server databases and other infrastructure
2 frontend developer  to build a responsive and accessible interface for web and mobile
3 uiux designer  to make the platform intuitive inclusive and welcoming for all users
4 qa tester  to ensure everything functions well across devices and meets accessibility standards

beyond tech skills wed need people dedicated to keeping the platform financially sustainable and accessible ideally wed have folks committed to organizing mutual aid and gathering ongoing resources to help with monthly maintenance like server costs and finding volunteers for outreach advertising the platform 

political ideologies are hollow if they dont translate into practical action and i truly believe that if we had an easy way to connect thousands of people would be eager to offer time resources or skills for their communities yes grassroots organizing through local groups is vital but lets be real many community orgs struggle to meet the needs of all members especially disabled and lowincome folks many dont even provide basic accommodations like masking which excludes some people from even participating

so if youre a leftist it professional or just someone with resources or passion for mutual aid lets make this happen reach out to me and lets talk about building a platform that can truly bring mutual aid into our communities in a sustainable accessible way 

and yes i understand it is all not that easy but nothing about our lives is easy that should not be used as an argument to avoid helping eachother",[deleted],Anarchism,11,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1gmfw1n/global_mutual_aid_platform/

 here are some other types of websites for anarchists

zines anarchists love zines little foldable essays that are easy to print and pass around leave them on the table at the cool coffee shop in the little lending libraries table a local show throw a zine fair crash a block party you can even make your own

here are some i can think of off the top of my head there are many many more









also anything from the anarchist library can be turned into a zine just hit the formatting button also hit the menu and other languages tab to see how many languages have a library now very impressive

im a recent college grad so i did that stuff at my school im back home now but i dont know any activist orgs in my area cause all my friends were through uni lol

i did some looking and it seems that groups like food not bombs arent particularly active i tried signing up but the latest their schedule went was march 2024

id like to get more involved with libsocs or mutual aid organizations in my area and start organizing

so if anyone is in chicagoland i dont want to be more specific on the internet especially given recent events id love to connect

2025-02-17 19:07:18,this is my grandfather,"this was my grandfather

he was an immigrant from greece who legally migrated to the usa  he learned how to read and write in english  he found an american sponsor somehow there was no internet back then and i doubt he even had telephone service in that small village in greece

once he was admitted he joined the united states army  after his military service he got married and had 4 children including my mother rip  life was hard but he worked hard and persevered  he busted his butt in the copper mines  he bought a home in montana  when his health deteriorated he bought a home in los angeles and moved to la  he was never on welfare  he did not expect handouts  he never broke the law and was never arrested  had he been refused entry he would not have entered illegally but rather would have remained in greece and lived the best life that he could

that is how you do it in my view  you dont hop a fence enter illegally and demand special privileges

a tale unfolds thats sad but true
the democrats once bold and grand
now find themselves without command

as trump parades his newfound might
they watch they fret both day and night
their strategies seem pale and weak
their voices soft when they should speak

in chambers where decisions brew
their influence is scant and few
they plot they plan they scheme they try
yet power slips and hopes run dry

oh what to do they often say
as policies are swept away
they rally protest pen their pleas
but find no cure for this disease

for in this game of thrones and power
they face a most tumultuous hour
to find their strength regain their say
or watch their influence decay

so heres a lesson clear and stark
in politics one must embark
with unity a steadfast crew

2025-02-17 00:38:28,america first legal federal judge mcconnell must recuse himself immediately,"tldr judge mcconnell has been heavily associated with a non profit that has gotten over 100m of govt funding including as chair of the board very recently therefore his impartiality can be challenged and he should recuse



as many of you may recall judge mcconnell issued a tro broadly prohibiting the government from freezing spendingi believe it was originally from some opm memo that they reversed before the tro then found the trump admin wasnt obeying the order



this is the one where to comply the govt would have to get preapproval for a broad range of cuts before doing them absurd 

i for one think the tro or a ro after it will all get tossed either by the judge or on appeal but it seems he has a credible conflict as outlined by am first legal in the thread so perhaps he will recuse himself shortly 

per am first legal federal law 28 usc  455 requires judges to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned

it seems like it can reasonably be questioned at this point 

my understanding is that if a judge declines to recuse that can be appealed and theres also a judgerun panel for alleged misconduct that can be leveraged congress could also impeach but thats very far down the road and probably would follow in a case where on appeal the finding was extra scathing in this case i doubt hes ruling this way for his non profit but it doesnt look good so i think he should recuse i do think the left venue shopped to get him knowing hed be sympathetic",Unlucky-Prize,Conservative,18,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ir79fm/america_first_legal_federal_judge_mcconnell_must/

2025-02-16 21:21:56,conservative professor  how should science work,"im a research professor in stem at a top american university i would consider myself to lean conservative though i never had much interest in politics i grew up in a very small rural town but half my family are ny liberals so i grew bored of the constant inane arguing between people who agree about nearly everything important im posting here because im interested in what you all think about hard science not anything cultural im talking microbiology physics applied math neuroscience etc 

over the long term basic science conducted at universities and funded by various governments mostly germany the uk and more recently the us has been by far the single largest driver of ever increasing prosperity this is an indisputable fact consider everything from antibiotics to nuclear power to computers basic science is also key to maintaining a powerful military private enterprise cannot and never has supported true basic science for two reasons 

 first too much risk with too long of a time horizon investment in basic science is far more risky than even venture capital and new ideas often take longer than a human life to generate profit thus it requires capital reserves and stability that only the strongest of governments possess  
 second it is difficult to assign ownership important leaps forward that ultimately result in new families of technology are built on free discourse and public access to other scientists research this makes it impossible for a private enterprise to both be productive in research and maintain ip long term

how do you address these problems in a conservative framework many of my colleagues are of the opinion that trump  doge will be a disaster for science but im not sure what do you think theyre trying to achieve i know many people who work at nih  nsf  doe the agencies providing most of the research money and they are confused by emails about dei policy when thats never been something they think about many of us are worried that cuts and chaos in research will harm the country in the long term by destroying the lead we have in science and technology i appreciate any thoughts

from my understanding liberalism liberal democracy includes the values of life liberty property individualism markets merit etc basically western values wouldnt that make democrats republicans and libertarians liberals they all believe those values so are conservatives and libertarians right wing liberals

so when maga says theyre illiberal does that mean theyre not democrats our not within the liberal democratic order answering the first or second have different answers

where do moderate conservatives fit in theyre leftish of maga but are they liberal in the sense people use it

2025-02-16 19:38:00,lets talk about wfh,"this subreddit seems to be one of the few places on reddit where i can voice a dissenting opinion without being banned so i want to bring this topic into discussion the republican and conservative party has taken a hardline stance against remote work opposing it even for roles that are perfectly suited for a workfromhome model

having worked from home for three years has been one of the best changes in my life i work in tech where the majority of my tasks are completed from a computeroften by remotely accessing servers or helping colleagues who are also working from home there is nothing i cant do just as well or even better at home versus in the office remote work has dramatically improved my worklife balance allowed me to spend more time with my wife and helped me find a healthy balance between my career and personal life

of course some jobs simply cannot be done remotely but every time i see people rallying against remote work it feels like their opposition comes from a place of resentment or misunderstanding many of these critics seem to have no idea what remote workers actually do their arguments often boil down to i had to suffer in an office so everyone else should too

i fail to see a single valid reason to deny someone the ability to work from home if their job can be performed remotely and they are doing it successfully sure there will always be a few people who abuse remote work but punishing the entire workforce for the actions of a few is shortsighted and counterproductive

this antiremotework stance reminds me of other losing cultural battles conservatives have foughtlike opposition to marijuana legalization  gay marriage whether one agrees or disagrees with those issues morally the reality is that the vast majority of americans support them and the average american doesnt seem to oppose working from home either opposition to these issues will cost the conservative movement significant support among younger voters and white collar workers 

the conservative movement has actually done a fantastic job of regaining control over the cultural zeitgeist over the last four yearsa space the left dominated for what seems like forever the reason i believe the left lost ground is because they fixated on issues that the average american simply doesnt care about from pushing transgender ideology  forcing lgbt narratives onto the entire country or generally pandering to small minorities over the broader public they alienated everyday people and drove voters into the conservative camp

however if conservatives continue their blanket opposition to remote work they risk falling into the same trapalienating voters over an issue that directly affects their quality of life younger generations deeply value worklife balance and flexibility by positioning themselves as the party of butts in seats rather than productivity and freedom conservatives are not only driving away a key demographic but also jeopardizing their hardwon gains in the broader cultural conversation

if conservatives want to maintain their momentum in the ongoing culture war they need to pick their battles more wisely remote work isnt a threat to conservative valuesits an opportunity to champion personal freedom individual responsibility and results over rigid rules",CartridgeCrusader23,Conservative,1237,2479,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ir0i7f/lets_talk_about_wfh/

i do think a post debate thread allowing conservatives to voice their opinions without being drown out by the left is also reasonable 

reddit leftists far outnumber the right many on the right refuse to use reddit

i would like to suggest a follow up thread for flaired conservatives to discuss it after if people dont engage we could scrap it i do think it will help though considering the left so easily drowns out the right in our own community

2025-02-14 18:45:12,question regarding budget,"question for the community

is there a way to see the us budget by deptdivisionagency

i think it would be great to see a list of every grouping the dollar amount and a 12 liner what they do

i see elon working fast but i would love to see this first before making changes so quickly

then we as a community can track a running total of the cuts and list as a community any proscons to those cuts

for example usaid is about 3040billion a year  which is a decent chunk but a lot of everything else is pretty small so far   it will all add up in the end but if we started a thread dedicated to keeping track it would be really cool and allow us to discuss and share thoughts on the risk of cutting a program vs the value

redundancies and programs that are bloated and running terrible will be the easy ones but usaid at least for me im a little mixed on because im not entirely sure how long term that will impact our foreign relations and strategic allies  this is where great discussions on reform vs cut and how potential reform could realistically be implemented

i have seen some stuff where china is already jumping in to posture they will be the replacement for usaid which in turn could weaken our global presence and allies   

would love to hear everyone elses thoughts on this

we know we got to make the cuts and get back to a surplus  i just would like to understand the process and how we are deciding it better   

elon is from the tech mindset when you have what we call in the industry technical debt sometimes the easiest way is to just turn it off see what breaks and then turn it back on later if you have to  that works sometimes with a company you may lose some customers or valuable employees but in government we could be leaving ourselves open to global moves that weaken us long term but look like a win in the short term

if there is already a thread on this please link  this was just in my head this morning and with stuff moving so fast it would be great to see the facts of what is actually happening consolidated",Antjel_1,Conservative,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1iphphk/question_regarding_budget/

this site no longer brings me any joy

is there any other social media alternative where i can get my fix of what this website used to be about i remember the days when people would actually post interesting things and i used to learn so much about life and its intricacies

im tired of the astroturfing and the brigading im tired of the overwhelming collective of this website being opposed to innovation and change im tired of being surrounded by people who want to blame others for their problems instead of championing their own life im tired of presenting facts and being downvoted to oblivion to the point where i no longer have any incentive to contribute different ideas on this website

we all have so little free time to ourselves outside of our obligations and im tired of spending it on this miserable platform its like the left is trying desperately to bring me down to their level and have me as miserable and sad as they are misery loves company as they say

i miss the old reddit so much where else is there to go

2025-02-14 17:13:03,how to work with liberals,"hi everyone this is my first time posting in this subreddit and im looking for some advice im trying to navigate managing my republican views in a very leftleaning company with liberal colleagues i really enjoy my work and my coworkers are great overall ive always been aware of their leftleaning perspectives

ive been with this company for three years and i havent had many issuesjust a few debates over gun laws with two very liberal coworkers who have since left my work area however recent events like an ice raid in our city and the ongoing discussions surrounding trumps downsizing have led to more political talk at work its especially prominent because i work in research and with the recent controversies around nih funding and rfk jr being head of hhs these topics are now part of conversations

to be upfront im not sure if i agree with cutting nih funding especially because my job is funded through grants that come from these sources and the cancer research i do offers vital treatment options where there are currently very few however i do agree there is a lot of wasteful government spending as highlighted by figures like elon musk and his doge team but the prospect of cuts to nih funding is concerning even for me i voted for trump and trust his leadership but i cant fully get behind everything thats being proposed in these areas and maybe its because i dont fully understand whats happening 

regarding my coworkers i feel outnumbered and a bit isolated because i dont share their views for instance during a coffee break today the conversation turned to how disgusted everyone was with trumps actions and i found myself just sitting there quietly scrolling on my phone im not an expert on politics or policies so i dont feel confident enough to voice a different opinion but i also dont want to feel like i have to sit alone during lab lunches or morning coffee hangouts i know as time goes on more of these conversations will come up and im not sure how to handle them without feeling like i have to withdraw from group events altogether

any advice on how to manage these situations without feeling out of place would be much appreciated thanks in advance",Perfectsaturn47,Conservative,61,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ipfilt/how_to_work_with_liberals/

as i entered my 20s and became an adult i found rush again this time as i started taking my own road trips   the older i became the more enjoyable his show became  for better or for worse he was always there with half is brain tied behind his back  as i entered my 30s and had kids myself they also got to hear rush while riding in the back seat my wife and i trying to explain some of what he was talking about to them im sure they felt the same way 

now that my own kids are entering their 20s i wish they could discover rush for themselves as adults his voice and even level headed logic is sorely missed

very very similar to communists at this point all liberals want is a one party state they dont want the option to vote outside of their party they would like their candidates picked for them because the party knows whats best

anyone who shows an ounce of conservatism is a nationalist a facist a right wing extremist etc any language they can use to shame you into following their party they will use

2025-02-13 19:02:33,republicans are wrong about abortion,"we won in 2024 by a small margin with politicians starting to consider the 2026 midterms we need to change how we look at abortion in order to convince more moderate and swing voters to pick republican we need to ensure a massive victory abortion needs to be illegal with the only exception being the life of the mother but we cant win by calling people evil murderers if they object they either simply dont care or are offended by it we cant compromise our values either by saying allowed until x weeks or with these exceptions the culture around children and parenthood needs to change many european and asian countries are heavily encouraging and promoting motherhood they have programs and resources to help families start out yet here in america we push abortion so what do we need to change

the reason so many people are proabortion is because there are many problems in our country that people sympathize with these people genuinely think death is a better alternative than living in our current society they view abortion as the solution republicans on the other hand view abortion as a problem that needs to be conquered but then they dont look at why people actually support it instead we should be looking at solutions that would make people happy to bring new life into this world 

the two most common excuses given for having an abortion are not being ready and not being able to afford it these two reasons make up roughly half of abortions and are somewhat similar women who arent ready to raise a child dont have the knowledge confidence or finances to raise a child the typical republican response is make it illegal and figure out your own problems  this response pushes people towards democrats who do have a solution its a solution we all disagree with but its more than nothing republicans do have an ability to do something about it we can influence the education system to incorporate extensive family planning into sex ex in schools and offer more education resources for adults some republicans are already willing to do this they just dont incorporate it into the abortion argument republicans should be saying if you arent ready to have a child dont get an abortion vote republican to ease your struggles and love your child

parents who cant afford to raise their child are struggling because of our rough economy the economy that is rough due to democrat policy republicans have already established that we are the ones to make the economy boom however when it comes to abortion women get told to figure it out on their own or pick yourself up by your bootstraps democrats have a solution have an abortion this is not the correct answer but having an answer draws more people to their side than no answer republicans should be saying dont have an abortion vote republican to make the economy stronger and you can afford your child

teen pregnancy is another common excuse given for legalizing abortion again with a republican led curriculum schools can offer support and education to teens who get pregnant encourage parents to help out and educate them on proper parenting these teens are seen as outcasts and villains which shouldnt be the case life should be celebrated even if its unplanned or too early 

a woman can always give up her child for adoption but the left complains that these systems lead to abuse and neglect some people doubt whether this claim is even accurate or not because the adoption system is already heavily regulated and monitored either way we just need republicans willing to take over the system and solve any potential issues republicans could advertise dont have an abortion vote republican to make the adoption system safer

there are plenty of other excuses given as well but my point is the same for all of them republicans should look for ways in which they can solve these very real problems with our society instead of telling people to fend for themselves if we actually fix these problems society as a whole would improve this way it would be easier to convince people that banning abortion outright is a good idea we need to praise mothers make them feel wanted instead of the outcast even outside of the abortion argument these are all things we should fix and encourage people to vote for a lot of this is also at the state level meaning this mid term election is important for more reasons than just the federal house and senate we need to make the swing states fully red",theboss2461,Conservative,250,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1ioqnqg/republicans_are_wrong_about_abortion/

its been over 20 years since the government operated without a deficit and we now have hope we might experience that again before trumps term ends i still fear those who have too much to lose from a lean and efficient government will do something radical to stop this great work worse they will likely attempt to field and fund a candidate in 2028 that allows them to refill the swamp  i know many are overjoyed about our actual conservatives recent victory but lets never forget the price of failure and how truly terrible the last four years have been this is just the beginning we have a lot of work to do to ensure america will be a sane wealthy and prosperous nation for our children and grandchildren

fast forward to 2025 trump rebrands it doge united states doge service keeps the acronym keeps the funding but gives it a whole new mission find the receipts 

legally untouchable because it was already fully funded and operational trump invokes 5 usc 3161 which allows him to create temporary hiring authorities doge teams get embedded inside every single federal agency each team consists of a lawyer hr rep a zoomer nerd and an investigator they report to doge not the agency theyre embedded in 

trump invokes 44 usc chapter 35 which governs federal it and cybersecurity oversight since usds was originally an it oversight body doge now has full access to all federal data systems

congress cant defund it because its not a new program just a repurposed one doj cant sue for overreach because trump used existing laws exactly as written 
doge operates within existing frameworks

 i started watching the other sides point of view and couldnt find much fault in their policies getting married and planning for a family also changes a lot perspective has shifted to responsibility fulfillment openmindedness and mostly accepting that i dont know everything my husband and i find ourselves always siding with conservatives now

problem is my friends are all liberals around my age and they are melting down i voted for trump and had to keep it a secret every time i hang out with them there is a struggle session we have to go over all the evils that trump and elon are doing theyre cutting off their families theyre in therapy twice a week some started taking antidepressants idk i have tried being kind and listening im at the end of my patience

xqc and adin ross werent having it calling her out for virtue signaling and pushing fake outrage like really since when is having an opinion on a performance some kind of moral test 

this whole situation just screams twitter activism at its finestshaming people for having personal taste while pretending to be some kind of moral authority meanwhile xqc and adin ross are exposing the double standards and hypocrisy behind her take

  
video on the whole subject click the text

what do you guys think is this another classic pokimane virtue signal or does she actually have a point



for the older people in the sub that might not know who these people are a more detailed breakdown of the events and people involved                    

pokimane  a popular twitch streamer and internet personality known for her gaming content and social commentary shes been involved in various online controversies often accused of being performative in her activism

xqc  a former professional overwatch player turned massive twitch streamer hes known for his loud personality unfiltered takes and reaction content

adin ross  a streamer who gained popularity through gaming interviews and his connection to internet drama he often gets involved in controversial discussions especially in the twitch and youtube communities

 what happened

during the super bowl halftime show kendrick lamar performed and while many people enjoyed it others didnt some criticized the performance for various reasonsmaybe they didnt like the song choices the stage setup or just preferred another artist

pokimane however took issue with those criticisms claiming that people who disliked kendricks performance were being racist this rubbed a lot of people the wrong way especially because disliking a performance doesnt automatically mean someone is racistsometimes people just dont like the music

this led to xqc and adin ross pushing back calling her out for virtue signalingwhich basically means acting like shes morally superior to gain social approval even if its not genuine they argued that not every opinion has to be tied to race and shaming people for their personal taste is ridiculous

 why its a big deal

this situation highlights the ongoing culture war on the internetwhere any opinion can turn into a heated debate about race morality and political correctness some people feel like pokimane was reaching just to score internet points while others think shes calling out real bias",Possible_Shirt_4935,Conservative,2,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1io3cgy/youtubers_calling_people_racist_for_not_liking/

2025-02-12 21:47:05,so i read the us constitution,"i dont know how you will take this since the constitution in america is some kind of a political gospel revered for itself

thats pretty unique anywhere else they revere the nature of the regime the republic the crown or the political principle democracy and freedom but not the text of the constitution

anyway so im a french conservative guy also happened to have a master degree in law here i read the us constitution following the conference by the white house spokeswoman explaining that judges censuring trump eo were leftist militants weaponizing justice to limit the lawful executive power of the president

and how to say this it is awfully dated and imprecise

the president really just is a referee of what the congress does hes also commander in chief for the army and militia militia  wtf 

its never about an executive power the president has or executive orders can give i guess layers and layers of court decisions had to make up for whats missing

i also heard about the two supreme court decisions one that said that persecuting the president for official act was a trespassing from the judiciary branch to the executive the other that said that regulation by agencies was a denial of the legislative branch

everything thats missing and is needed is a legal and political battleground so good luck with that

if it wasnt such a gospel you could just write it all down again with precised provisions of what the president and anyone can do with the ways and forms technical regulations can be made",Juract,Conservative,55,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1io2qip/so_i_read_the_us_constitution/

2025-02-12 16:57:54,what pivotal points over the past few years have made you vote red,"for me it was 1the mueller report and horowitz report squashing russiagate and 2 when the dnc actively worked against sanders 

i remember spending an hours with my politics professor talking about the web of russia collusion accusations i was so fascinated that treason was unfolding in real time the interweb of this billionaire businessman colluding with foreign enemy when the information came out i was so confused about how my perception of reality was wrong

in regards to dnc i will never be a socialist i disagree with it fully however sanders was telling a message that things were rigged against the commoner i respected him for standing up to traditional way of thinking i remember seeing a picture of him when he was younger at a protest i think kent state but no it 100 sure and respected that he stayed true to himself then the dnc colluded against him and instead of fighting for what he believed in he just rolled over now at the dnc he goes up after one billionaire complains about billionaires then another billionaire comes out to speak he doesnt respect himself so i can longer respect him

2025-02-12 05:23:32,cheers to the competency crisis,"just want to issue a perspective i have

i grew up poor as hell in new jersey father died when i was 10 and my ma was an alcoholic who still managed to keep me and my sister fed 

ive worked in the trades since i was 14 and i am now 37 i graduated high in my class in high school but chose to continue in my feild instead 

i moved to nyc in 2009 making something like 18hr in infrastructure repair i was told repeatedly by my friendsfamilycolleagues that i shouldve gone to college to get a better job that would pay better 

now im a foreman and make around 150k175k zero debts my whole life hardwork does in fact lead to success you just need to have a half decent brain and a willingness to actually work hard to profit a company never on unemployment  never stopped working during covid 

politicians and the government as an entirety have never represented me and those around me they have abandoned the thought of who keeps this country running 

gov jobs definitely dont mean a damn to the general public so why do dems give so much care to it i get 3x pay to work in canada and south america during crisis america isnt paying my wages during this period

my take is that we have an exorbitant amount of useless labor theyve got nothing to offer but a bleeding heart and a desperate need to feel useful 

dont stop at doge please also remove the dob legislators the failed architect turned project managers and the state union contracts all for unions as an entity but ive run 60 man crews and have seen tax dollars be burned before my eyes literal nepotism families who can hang a single zclip in 10 hours because the foreman isnt there to do layout 

they are all losing it and ive never felt better things are starting to make perfect sense

meanwhile conservatives are brainwashing millions online while were still stuck walking door to door like its 2008 protesting is important ill try to go tomorrow but we need a complimentary online blitz

how can we flip the switch

where is the energy of the tiktokers who trolled trump by buying out his rally tickets 

what if we formed our own version of a bot farm except with real humans us where we target specific posts or upvote certain comments im dead serious is it right is it ethical who cares anymore we could start a signal chat call ourselves doge  disbanding oligarchy gaining equality

billboards trolling elon and trump 

a billboard of that picture elon hates where hes balding and the line this guy has access to your data i think trump getting in bed with the other billionaire bros is a huge weak spot for maga and the weak link we need to exploit 

a billboard of bezos zuck musk and trump that says they get rich you get screwed

i have the time i have money to spend but i cant sponsor billboards on my own i also dont feel tech savvy enough to really tackle any of this without help

side note

democrat is becoming a dirty word i have seen this on tiktok with many of our young adults not wanting to identify as democrat even if they are left they prefer leftist which leads them to follow creators who spend more time attacking democrats than republicans 

i understand and share your critiques of the party but every time you comment something like the democrats have no balls or feels like we have no opposition party it enforces apathy and suppresses turnout you might still vote despite your frustration but 50 people who read your comment may not plus its not exactly true there are democrats everywhere fighting i am proud of my senators in oregon who fight daily they dont have tiktok so are not seen like aoc

look at 2025trump barely shows up when he does he stumbles through speeches loses his train of thought and rambles incoherently and sure hes always rambled but this is different before even when he was spewing nonsense he had energythis weird chaotic showmanship that kept people engaged now he just looks lost like hes struggling to keep up

the people running the show elon musk jd vance stephen miller the heritage foundationare doing their most extreme dystopian work because they know trumps base will go along with it trump isnt thinking through policies or making decisions he just signs whatever they put in front of him the new maga leaders arent following himtheyre using him waiting for him to fade so they can take over completely

and something feels off about all of it his rambling used to feel intentional like he was riffing and playing to the crowd now it just feels like hes confused meandering and barely aware of what hes saying his movement is moving on without him and hes just along for the ride

but its not just that hes weakertheres a different vibe now it feels more sinister yeah hes been through a lot with the courts and everything but it also feels like hes put people in charge who are really going to push that agenda harder than he ever could theres just something missing and i cant quite put my finger on it it feels almost like a weekend at bernies situation  not sandersits a terrible 80s movie",mistymiso,Liberal,178,440,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ipv3c6/something_feels_different_about_trump/

what this leads me to belive is if his approval rating is in the 40 to 43 range then it is very likely for the democrats to take back the house in 2026 since thats the maragin he had in 2018 which cost him the house as a result

who can stop the coup and how a brief guide

step 1 courts

many lawsuits have been filed and continue to be filed against the executive branch judges have already begun issuing injunctions and rulings against the executive branch if the executive branch abides by the injunctions and rulings or abides while appealing the cases and ultimately abides by the final ruling the coup stops here  if not proceed to step 2 

note if a case reaches the supreme court and the partisan justices issue a blatantly unconstitutional ruling skip ahead to step 3 

step 2 doj

a judge can rule that the defendant is in contempt of court then the department of justice which is part of the executive branch orders the us marshals to arrest them and bring them to court if the doj does its job the coup stops here  if not proceed to step 3 

step 3 congress

congress has the power to impeach and convict the president vice president supreme court justices and any civil officers of the united states upon conviction the person found guilty is removed from office if congress does its job the coup stops here  if not proceed to step 4 

step 4 the people

nonviolent protests that engage at least 35 of the population have historically never failed in the us this threshold is around 12 million people 75 million people voted for kamala harris so this threshold amounts to 16 of harris voters the coup stops here 

actions you can take during the steps above

 call your us senators and congress rep every day 5 calls app  this easy put pressure on them to stop the coup tell them to use their media influence to inform the public about the coup
 spread the word make sure your friends and family know about the coup
 if youre a journalist remind your editors that were in the middle of a coup it deserves as much if not more coverage than a plane crash
 if youre a federal employee hold the line dont resign
 if youre active military remember that youre legally required to disobey unlawful orders

2025-02-09 17:54:31,ron howard sums up this nicely,"lori gallagher nailed this 


im a liberal but that doesnt mean what a lot of you apparently think it does lets break it down shall we because quite frankly im getting a little tired of being told what i believe and what i stand for spoiler alert not every liberal is the same though the majority of liberals i know think along roughly these same lines

1 i believe a country should take care of its weakest members a country cannot call itself civilized when its children disabled sick and elderly are neglected period

2 i believe healthcare is a right not a privilege somehow thats interpreted as i believe obamacare is the endall beall this is not the case im fully aware that the aca has problems that a national healthcare system would require everyone to chip in and that its impossible to create one that is devoid of flaws but i have yet to hear an argument against it that makes let people die because they cant afford healthcare a better alternative i believe healthcare should be far cheaper than it is and that everyone should have access to it and no im not opposed to paying higher taxes in the name of making that happen

3 i believe education should be affordable it doesnt necessarily have to be free though it works in other countries so im mystified as to why it cant work in the us but at the end of the day there is no excuse for students graduating college saddled with five or sixfigure debt

4 i dont believe your money should be taken from you and given to people who dont want to work i have literally never encountered anyone who believes this ever i just have a massive moral problem with a society where a handful of people can possess the majority of the wealth while there are people literally starving to death freezing to death or dying because they cant afford to go to the doctor fair wages lower housing costs universal healthcare affordable education and the wealthy actually paying their share would go a long way toward alleviating this somehow believing that makes me a communist

5 i dont throw around im willing to pay higher taxes lightly if im suggesting something that involves paying more well its because im fine with paying my share as long as its actually going to something besides lining corporate pockets or bombing other countries while americans die without healthcare

6 i believe companies should be required to pay their employees a decent livable wage somehow this is always interpreted as me wanting burger flippers to be able to afford a penthouse apartment and a mercedes what it actually means is that no one should have to work three fulltime jobs just to keep their head above water restaurant servers should not have to rely on tips multibilliondollar companies should not have employees on food stamps workers shouldnt have to work themselves into the ground just to barely make ends meet and minimum wage should be enough for someone to work 40 hours and live

7 i am not antichristian i have no desire to stop christians from being christians to close churches to ban the bible to forbid prayer in school etc btw prayer in school is not illegal compulsory prayer in school is  and should be  illegal all i ask is that christians recognize my right to live according to my beliefs when i get pissed off that a politician is trying to legislate scripture into law im not offended by christianity  im offended that youre trying to force me to live by your religions rules you know how you get really upset at the thought of muslims imposing sharia law on you thats how i feel about christians trying to impose biblical law on me be a christian do your thing just dont force it on me or mine

8 i dont believe lgbt people should have more rights than you i just believe they should have the same rights as you

9 i dont believe illegal immigrants should come to america and have the world at their feet especially since this isnt what they do spoiler undocumented immigrants are ineligible for all those programs theyre supposed to be abusing and if theyre stealing your job its because your employer is hiring illegally i believe there are far more humane ways to handle undocumented immigration than our current practices ie detaining children splitting up families ending daca etc

10 i dont believe the government should regulate everything but since greed is such a driving force in our country we need regulations to prevent cut corners environmental destruction tainted foodwater unsafe materials in consumable goods or medical equipment etc its not that i want the governments hands in everything  i just dont trust people trying to make money to ensure that their productspracticesetc are actually safe is the government devoid of shadiness of course not but with those regulations in place consumers have recourse if theyre harmed and companies are liable for medical bills environmental cleanup etc just kind of seems like common sense when the alternative to government regulation is letting companies bring their bottom line into the equation

11 i believe our current administration is fascist not because i dislike them or because i cant get over an election but because ive spent too many years reading and learning about the third reich to miss the similarities not because any administration i dislike must be nazis but because things are actually mirroring authoritarian and fascist regimes of the past

12 i believe the systemic racism and misogyny in our society is much worse than many people think and desperately needs to be addressed which means those with privilege  white straight male economic etc  need to start listening even if you dont like what youre hearing so we can start dismantling everything thats causing people to be marginalized

13 i am not interested in coming after your blessed guns nor is anyone serving in government what i am interested in is the enforcement of present laws and enacting new common sense gun regulations got another opinion put it on your page not mine

14 i believe in socalled political correctness i prefer to think its social politeness if i call you chuck and you say you prefer to be called charles ill call you charles its the polite thing to do not because everyone is a delicate snowflake but because as maya angelou put it when we know better we do better when someone tells you that a term or phrase is more accurateless hurtful than the one youre using you now know better so why not do better how does it hurt you to not hurt another person

15 i believe in funding sustainable energy including offering education to people currently working in coal or oil so they can change jobs there are too many sustainable options available for us to continue with coal and oil sorry billionaires maybe try investing in something else

16 i believe that women should not be treated as a separate class of human they should be paid the same as men who do the same work should have the same rights as men and should be free from abuse why on earth shouldnt they be

i think that about covers it bottom line is that im a liberal because i think we should take care of each other that doesnt mean you should work 80 hours a week so your lazy neighbor can get all your money it just means i dont believe there is any scenario in which preventable suffering is an acceptable outcome as long as money is saved

2025-02-09 00:24:09,worry about schools using right wing curriculum,"i recently wrote a strongly worded email to my childs principal and district superintendent and honestly anyone else that looked mildly important on the district website about the indoctrination of k12 schools executive order and how worried i was for the changes in curriculum that it implies 

i got an accidental reply someone in the district forwarded it to someone else and said it was a form letter but they should reply to me anyways it actually isnt a form letter but it got me thinkingmaybe it could be so here it is in case anyone else wants to edit it send it to whoever will be most bothered 


to whom it may concern

my name is  and i am a concerned parent within the  school district i am deeply disturbed over the current presidents executive order for ending radical indoctrination in k12 schooling

this executive order is in itself an appalling and overzealous attempt to indoctrinate my child and the children of our community into believing a singular and all together false account of our national history

i am writing to you today to specifically talk about section 3 b 

viii  the united states is fundamentally racist sexist or otherwise discriminatory

and the following section d
patriotic education means a presentation of the history of america grounded in 
i    an accurate honest unifying inspiring and ennobling characterization of americas founding and foundational principles 
ii   a clear examination of how the united states has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history 
iii  the concept that commitment to americas aspirations is beneficial and justified and
iv   the concept that celebration of americas greatness and history is proper

i have the utmost trust in our collegeeducated professionally trained and licensed teachers to display a developmentally appropriate yet accurate reflection of history throughout all grade levels however i am concerned for the ways that our schools curriculum may be forced to change either within this school year or the years following to accommodate the aforementioned demands

the federal government is trying to enforce by a law a subjective manner of tone what exactly constitutes accurate and ennobling when considering the ways various marginalized citizens have fought to earn human rights in america

subverting the racial and sexist reality of our nations history erases our community members struggles laying the groundwork for future discrimination and creating an environment where the subjective tone of factual events can be punishable by law and funding 

i ask that you are transparent if and when  school and all schools within  school district are altering any policies or curriculum to accommodate the aforementioned and all additional sections of this executive order

and i demand as a community member and parent that you dont allow the extreme overreach of federal government into our childrens education and livelihood

similarities

1 backlash against modernization

    in afghanistan rapid modernization efforts in the 20th centurysuch as womens education and secular reformsprovoked strong resistance from conservative rural populations leading to a reversal toward religious conservatism

    in the us cultural debates over progressive policies eg gender rights education reforms have fueled polarization with some groups advocating for a return to traditional or religious values


2 urbanrural divide

    afghanistan experienced a widening gap between urban elites embracing modernization and rural communities adhering to traditional islamic norms2

    similarly the us has seen divisions between urban areas leaning progressive and rural regions favoring conservative ideologies


3 rise of religious conservatism

    in afghanistan political instability and external interventions enabled the rise of islamist movements like the taliban which imposed strict religious laws

    in the us there has been a resurgence of christian nationalist rhetoric among certain political factions emphasizing religions role in governance


4 polarization and reactionary movements

    in both contexts societal polarization has led to reactionary movements opposing perceived threats to cultural or religious identity whether through islamization in afghanistan or conservative pushes in the us


while the specifics differafghanistans changes were shaped by war and foreign interventionthe underlying dynamics of resistance to rapid change and cultural divides are comparable",WeenFan4Life,Liberal,21,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ijzf9h/what_do_you_think_afghanistan_in_70s_vs_us_today/
2025-02-07 16:06:29,the only way to break through is to connect what is happening to programs republics care about usaids food for peace was created by title ii of the 2018 farm bill the food from this program comes from american farmers here is a summary and quotes from republicans on the value of this program,"if you are in a district that is represented by one of these representatives call and ask them why they are letting elon musk an unelected private citizen hurt american farmers by shutting down usaid look below and remind them of their own words   
  
even if your representative is not listed ask them why they are letting elon musk hurt american famers by shutting down the usaid which funding is under the authority of congress

one of the most important statements from the summary

gtseveral members expressed concern about the administrations budget requests to reduce or eliminate funding for programs that utilize us agricultural commodities fearing it would negatively impact american farmers



this document is a transcript of a house committee hearing titled the implementation of farm bill international food assistance and development programs the hearing took place on december 10 2019 before the subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture of the house committee on agriculture

the hearing focused on the implementation of the international food assistance and development programs authorized by the 2018 farm bill key topics and themes discussed during the hearing include

 the importance of international food assistance programs in addressing humanitarian needs enhancing national security and promoting global stability and cooperation
 the role of various programs such as mcgoverndole food for education food for progress and food for peace these programs aim to provide food assistance improve agricultural practices and build capacity in developing countries
 the collaboration between the us department of agriculture usda and the us agency for international development usaid in implementing these programs both agencies work with various partners including nongovernmental organizations and international organizations
 the emphasis on using us agricultural commodities in food aid programs members of the subcommittee expressed concern that there may be a bias towards cash and vouchers and wanted to ensure american farmers and their products are a key part of the programs
 the importance of program oversight and accountability to ensure that aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and is not misused monitoring methods include thirdparty monitoring biometric registration and feedback hotlines
 the budget requests from the administration to consolidate international food assistance programs into a single account which would reduce funding for some programs this proposed consolidation raised concerns among committee members who believe it would diminish the role of the usda and potentially reduce the amount of us commodities used in the food programs
 the role of these programs in national security by increasing global stability and cooperation the programs also aim to promote international partnerships and mutually beneficial trading relationships

the hearing included testimonies from ken isley administrator of the foreign agricultural service at usda and trey hicks director of the office of food for peace at usaid members of the subcommittee asked questions and expressed their views on the implementation of these programs

several representatives expressed comments and concerns regarding farmers american farmers and farm families during the house committee hearing on the implementation of farm bill international food assistance and development programs these comments emphasize the importance of supporting american agriculture through international food assistance programs

here are some of the key points made by the representatives

 jim costa democrat chairman of the subcommittee stated that american farmers ranchers dairymen and women are the ones who produce the food for these programs and nobody does it better than the american farmer he emphasized that providing support improves livelihoods and builds partnerships throughout the breadbasket of america
 david rouzer republican ranking member of the subcommittee highlighted the role of american farmers in producing the crops delivered through inkind food aid he stated that a bag of rice wheat flour or any one of dozens of other products grown by us farmers are powerful symbols of the productivity and generosity of america he also noted that food assistance and international agriculture development rely on partnerships with fine farm families and food processors in the united states he stressed that us farm products are the true backbone of the assistance the united states provides and that american agriculture inkind assistance remains as the backbone for years to come
 k michael conaway republican a representative in congress from texas stated that there is a strong partnership between usda and usaid and a broad coalition of stakeholders both in the united states and internationally he expressed concern that there may be a bias in favor of cash and vouchers over inkind food purchases and wanted to ensure that american farmers participate in these programs he also noted that the american people support these programs in large part because they believe it is americangrown products that are being used
 collin c peterson democrat a representative in congress from minnesota noted that dry peas and lentils which are a staple in international food assistance programs had dropped significantly in price he pointed out that this drop in price should have resulted in more purchases of these commodities benefiting american farmers who produce them
 roger w marshall republican a representative in congress from kansas mentioned the history of the food for peace program which was started by a kansas farmer and later signed into legislation by president eisenhower also from kansas he also emphasized that it is important to him that the programs use agriculture products made in the us
 jim hagedorn passed away but his words are important a representative in congress from minnesota stated that these programs demonstrate the wonderful system of agriculture that we have the expertise and the technology and in ag land with our farmers hard work and the work that is done by our agribusinesses puts us in a position not just to trade with other countries and help provide food but to literally give it away in many instances here to help people all around the world he added we are very much interested in you taking products from our farmers and sending them to other countries and not necessarily distribute cash payments we think that that is very important
 don bacon republican a representative in congress from nebraska stated that nebraska is proud of being like the lead exporter for beef and go up and down the line and agriculture is one of our nations strengths and it is a source of our nations power and prosperity and i just tell you our farmers and our agriculture sector in nebraska are proud to help feed the world and we prefer not handing a check we like providing our surplus which we have he also noted that american farmers are a force for good

in summary the representatives from both sides of the aisle showed a strong interest in ensuring that american farmers and farm families benefit from international food assistance programs by selling their products and also through having the programs enhance the image of american agriculture globally they expressed concerns about potential shifts away from inkind aid and towards cash assistance which they see as a threat to american agricultural producers

2025-02-05 16:03:54,for those of you looking to turn your anger into action,"heres some advice from a highlevel staffer for a senator reposting from a friend of mine  
there are two things that we should be doing all the time right now and theyre by far the most important things  
you should not be bothering with online petitions or emailing  
  
1 the best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have facetoface time  if they have town halls go to them go to their local offices if youre in dc try to find a way to go to an event of theirs go to the mobile offices that their staff hold periodically all these times are located on each congresspersons website when you go ask questions a lot of them and push for answers the louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better  
  
2 but those inperson events dont happen every day so the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling  
  
you should make 6 calls a day  
2 each dc office and your local office to your 2 senators amp your 1 representative  
  
the staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash unless you have a particularly strong emotional story  but even then its not worth the time it took you to craft that letter  
  
calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to every single day the senior staff and the senator get a report of the 3 mostcalledabout topics for that day at each of their offices in dc and local offices and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics theyre also sorted by zip code and area code she said that republican callers generally outnumber democrat callers 41 and when its a particular issue that singleissuevoters pay attention to like gun control or planned parenthood funding etc its often closer to 111 and thats recently pushed republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the republicans in the last 8 years republicans have called and democrats havent  
  
so when you call  
     a when calling the dc office ask for the staff member in charge of whatever youre calling about hi id like to speak with the staffer in charge of healthcare please  local offices wont always have specific ones but they might if you get transferred to that person awesome if you dont thats ok  ask for that persons name and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone dont leave a message unless the office doesnt pick up at all  then you can  but its better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic  
   
give them your zip code they wont always ask for it but make sure you give it to them so they can mark it down extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them since theyll want to make sure they getkeep your vote  
  
     c if you can make it personal make it personal i voted for you in the last election and im worriedhappywhatever or im a teacher and i am appalled by betsy devos or as a single mother or as a white middle class woman or whatever  
  
     d pick 12 specific things per day to focus on dont rattle off everything youre concerned about  theyre figuring out what 12 topics to mark you down for on their lists so focus on 12 per day ideally something that will be voted ontaken up in the next few days but it doesnt really matter  even if theres not a vote coming up in the next week call anyway its important that they just keep getting calls  
  
     e be clear on what you want  im disappointed that the senator or i want to thank the senator for their vote on  or i want the senator to know that voting in  way is the wrong decision for our state because  dont leave any ambiguity  
  
     f they may get to know your voiceget sick of you  it doesnt matter the people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway so even if theyre really sick of you theyll be gone in 6 weeks  
  
from experience since the election if you hate being on the phone amp feel awkward which is a lot of people dont worry about it  there are a bunch of scripts indivisible has some there are lots of others floating around these day after a few days of calling it starts to feel a lot more natural  
  
put the 6 numbers in your phone all under p  politician an example is mccaskill mo politician mccaskill dc politician blunt mo etc which makes it really easy to click down the list each day",plasticpixels,Liberal,34,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1iidej4/for_those_of_you_looking_to_turn_your_anger_into/

subject urgent action needed to prevent the exploitation of incarcerated individuals in medical research amp protect human rights

dear senators name

i am writing to express my deep concern regarding the potential exploitation of incarcerated individuals in experimental medical research particularly as neuralink a company owned by elon musk begins human trials for its controversial braincomputer interface bci technology given musks erratic behavior and neuralinks history of unethical animal testing there is a real and urgent risk that prisonerswho are among the most vulnerable populations in the uscould be coerced or incentivized into dangerous experiments with inadequate oversight and informed consent

while existing regulations under the common rule 45 cfr 46 subpart c provide some restrictions on medical research involving prisoners loopholes remain that allow private companies to

 target incarcerated individuals as test subjects leveraging their lack of autonomy and limited access to legal representation
 use financial incentives or promises of better treatment to pressure participation making true informed consent questionable
 claim that participation is voluntary when in reality the prison environment inherently creates coercive conditions

given neuralinks troubling track recordincluding reports of animal suffering rushed testing procedures and serious safety concerns raised by the fdait is imperative that congress acts now to prevent the exploitation of prisoners in experimental research that does not serve their direct medical interests

 additional concern expansion of guantnamo bay detention facility

furthermore i am alarmed by recent reports that the administration plans to expand the detention facilities at guantnamo bay to house up to 30000 deported migrants as part of the laken riley act and accompanying executive actions this expansion raises significant human rights concerns particularly regarding the potential for detainees to be subjected to experimental medical procedures without proper consent the combination of an increased detained population and the initiation of human trials by companies like neuralink heightens the risk of unethical practices

 escalating threat us withdrawal from the un human rights council

in addition to these alarming developments president trump has announced the withdrawal of the united states from the united nations human rights council unhrc and the cessation of funding for the un agency aiding palestinian refugees unrwa apnewscom

the unhrc serves as a critical global watchdog against human rights violations including unethical medical experimentation coercion and abuse of vulnerable populations this withdrawal diminishes international oversight and increases the risk of human rights abuses going unchecked

the us has a documented history of medical experimentation on prisonersfrom the tuskegee syphilis experiments to radiation testing on inmates we must not allow billionaires and private corporations to revive these unethical practices under the guise of innovation especially at a time when the us is distancing itself from international human rights protections

 proposed legislative protections

i urge you to introduce or support new legislation that would

 explicitly prohibit highrisk medical experiments on incarcerated individuals unless the research directly benefits their own health and wellbeing
 close loopholes that allow private corporations to conduct research on prisoners under the guise of voluntary participation
 mandate strict thirdparty oversight and legal representation for any study involving incarcerated individuals
 implement severe penalties for companies found to be coercing or targeting prisoners for experimental trials
 ban private companies from lobbying to weaken prisoner protections in medical research
 ensure the us remains accountable to international human rights standards despite its withdrawal from the unhrc

this is not just a medical ethics issueit is a human rights issue i urge you to take immediate action to protect vulnerable individuals from corporate exploitation and prevent neuralinkor any other private entityfrom using prisoners as test subjects for unproven highrisk medical procedures

thank you for your time leadership and commitment to justice i look forward to your response

2025-02-04 23:06:23,prochoice people clearly care more about the issue and are more passionateenthusiastic about the issue,"therefore single issue voting on abortion benefits prochoice people more than it benefits prolife people 

a report by gallup published in june of 2024 cited the following statistics 

 54 of americans are prochoice 

this does not mean that 46 of americans are prolife some people are not sure what they think or simply do not care much about the issue 

 41 of americans identify as prolife 

that is a decrease from a decade prior 

 40 of prochoice voters say that they would not vote for a candidate who disagrees with them on abortion compared to only 22 of prolife voters 

think about that even if someone is prolife they might be willing to vote for a prochoice candidate if the prochoice candidate agrees with them them being the prolife voters on a different issue an opposite scenario a prochoice voter supporting a prolife candidate due to agreement regarding a different issue is statistically far less likely to happen 

 

according to usa today a lot of republicans are dropping their antiabortion values either turning prochoice or just becoming more willing to compromise on it and that is how trump was able to win and how the republicans were able to take control of both the senate and the house donald trump actually said that if congress tried to pass a nationwide abortion ban he would veto it 

 

the above article by usa today was written by an antiabortion advocate explaining why trumps reelection probably will not signify that the prolife crowd is anywhere near ending abortion once and for all 

opinion based assessments of current events should usually be taken with a grain of salt because they can be tinted by wishful thinking however the aforementioned article by usa today was written by dace potas an actual antiabortion advocate if potas is going to skew the data because of wishful thinking potas would probably do so in such a way as to make the situation seem much better for the antiabortion people or much worse for prochoice people than is the case here in reality it seems pretty unlikely that someone who wants to end abortion would skew the data to make it seem better for supporters of abortion rights or worse for opponents of abortion rights than is the case here in reality  

as a prochoice person i feel that this is good news however it makes me wonder what percent of the people in the antiabortion crowd have really thought through the issue 

the prolife position literally says a fetus is a person the fetus right to live takes precedent over a womans right to control what happens to her body and this issue is so important that the government has a duty to intervene and force a woman to remain pregnant

2025-02-04 23:04:05,trump is purging federal law enforcement so he can pull off his reichstag fire,"thanks to their private texts and public pronouncements we know that trump and his lackeys have salivated for years over the prospect of marshall law we also know from trumps inaction on j6 his ritual celebration of that days violence his vilification of the cops who defended the capitol and his pardons of copbludgeoning brownshirts that he is procoup and we know from his campaign promises that hes chomping at the bit to sic the us military on us citizens he just needs a pretext and once again his proud boys are standing by to provide it the only thing stopping them is federal law enforcement and trump can remove this obstacle by purging agents with integrity who do their jobs 

the day after the fire at hitlers request president hindenburg signed the reichstag fire decree into law according to wikipedia the decree suspended most civil liberties in germany including habeas corpus freedom of expression freedom of the press the right of free association and public assembly and the secrecy of the post and telephone which squares pretty well with trumps wish list for america 

the reichstag fire decree wikipedia continues was used by the nazis to ban publications not considered friendly trump has of course proposed doing just that to unfriendly fake news outlets 

hitler after having obtained his emergency powers announced that it was the start of a wider communist effort to take over germany per wikipedia sounds like the deep state conspiracies of trumps paranoid fantasies

its a long shot but its the only thing giving me hope right now

there are three special elections happening in april two in florida one in ny if dems won all three they would have control of the house even winning one seat to help close the gap would be a major success to stopping these bills being introduced

what can you do to help

if you know someone who is in these districts make sure they know the date of the vote and where to vote make sure they show up with no incumbent to vote for and no trump on the ticket theres a good chance the hardcore maga voters will stay home those in the middle have started to see the path that maga is putting us on and can be swayed to vote dem

if you have the time volunteer my personal favorite nonprofit is sister district which has volunteers do postcard writing text message trees and phone banks to call voters in other districts to advocate for progressive candidates

a joint legal defense fund to fight federal abuses

our local newspaper which employed 250 people when i started in the 1990s now has a handful of employees who cannot cover the community local television news is equally hamstrung

at the national level fox news podcasters social media and tiktok have replaced what used to be balanced nightly news coverage newspapers and print magazines these sources have totally coopted what used to be the traditional media space and have been essential in conservative viewpoints taking over the media landscape

some sources  the associated press reuters and several other traditional offerings  still offer value though i fear they are little read or consumed in the public square we have a few stillpopular media spaces however most focus on delivering news comedically the daily show still reigns supreme in this regard though jon oliver gives it a run for its money just about any day colbert and some others still have their place but they are mainly preaching to the choir and as jon stewarts recent chill out dudes it aint fascism yet  rant shows they are all not always capable or trustworthy allies

therefore for the left to succeed in delivering its message effectively we must work to create the alternative media landscape republicans and the far right have so effectively crafted we are behind far far far behind what are the necessary steps to build the groundswell that will be required to combat where we stand and how do we do that when the spaces we need to utilize are owned by oligarchs kissing the ring of the very people we must fight",GreatPumpkin72,Liberal,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1igst5f/building_our_alternate_media_empire_a_necessary/

during his tenure trump has aggressively pursued policies that hurt his opponents while primarily benefiting wealthy elites and corporations and leaving his rural lowincome and workingclass supporters behind his tax cuts overwhelmingly favored the rich and large businesses while providing little longterm relief for middle and low income americans his administrations rollback of environmental protections benefited fossil fuel companies but led to increased pollution in rural and industrial areas disproportionately harming workingclass communities and poc while he claimed to fight for american jobs his trade wars hurt farmers and small businesses many of whom supported him but suffered from lost markets and increased costs his attacks on the affordable care act and cuts to social programs disproportionately affected lowincome voters including many in the maga movement who rely on medicaid food assistance and disability benefits meanwhile his deregulation of industries opposition to minimum wage increases and support for corporate interests have made it harder for working class americans to earn a living wage overall trumps policies have strengthened the wealth and power of corporations and the ultrarich while leaving many of his most loyal supporters struggling with stagnant wages rising healthcare costs and worsening economic inequality sothis leaves me to understand that trumps overarching plan is not to strengthen the republican party or even christian ideology it is to make life extremely difficult for democrats those that oppose farright policies and anyone else who challenges him some people just like to see the world burn

2025-02-03 09:23:06,the republican party appears to be becoming less homophobic,"in 2020 the supreme court ruled that employment discrimination against gay people is unconstitutional the reason behind this decision was as follows if a man who is in a relationship with another man is subject to employment discrimination because he is in a relationship with a man but a woman can be in a relationship with a man without facing any such discrimination that is gender discrimination republican justices john roberts and neil gorsuch who were appointed by george w bush and donald trump respectively voted with the majority two republican justices voted in favor of gay rights 

open a us history textbook and you may notice a trend that has occurred over the past 150 years there is a group of people women gay people racial minorities etc who do not enjoy the same rights and protections under the law as others there is controversy there the issue really is as simple as one side of the debate says that this group should enjoy the same rights and opportunities as everyone else the other side believes that that group of people should be treated as second class citizens the latter groups entire argument is it is good when x group does it but yucky when y group does it the controversy really is as simple as that when this happens usually a few people to the left of the political spectrum speak up and advocate for this positive change but it seems unlikely that this change will ever occur year after year more and more people on the political left not only advocate for it but attend marches and hold protests eventually pretty much everyone on the left supports giving equal rights to this marginalized group and the right is deeply divided on whether or not these people should enjoy equal rights decades later we have reached a point where the vast majority of people barring a very small minority of people agree that the right in question should be granted to all people it is amazing to most of us that this was ever controversial 

here are a few examples of what i mean 

when the constitution was first ratified women could not vote around the late 19th and early 20th century a small minority of people began to entertain the thought that maybe women should vote most people even women themselves believed otherwise some people worried that women were too emotional to vote to that i say who is to say that being emotional automatically means that any vote you cast will be misguided some people felt that every woman would just vote the same as her husband not only is there a fairly decent chance that at least some women maybe even a lot of women would not vote the same way as their husbands this argument fails to consider that unmarried people might vote the social custom where women and children were to be the first ones rescued in a disaster was created to fuel the idea that women do not need to vote because men will always prioritise womens interests when voting to that i say women could also prioritize mens best interests when voting after all every man who has ever voted would not have been able to vote if his mother had not given him life besides women bring a unique perspective that men are not capable of bringing and vice versa even if men prioritize womens best interests when voting there may be certain things these men did not consider that a woman may have been more likely to consider when the 19th amendment was ratified a lot of people were mad about it nowadays the vast majority of people agree that women should be allowed to vote in fact it seems kind of surprising that anyone would ever be against letting women vote 

throughout the first half of the 20th century black where were oppressed by jim crow laws and other racist policies in the supreme court case known as plessey v ferguson it was ruled that things that are for black people and things that are for white people could be separate but they had to be equal the problem of course is that a lot of the time they where not equal if you had one restaurant for whites and another for colored people the bathrooms in the white restaurants would be cleaner the cooks in the white restaurant would be more skilled and experienced etc apparently if a black man had just used the bathroom there is something wrong with it if a white man uses that same bathroom the white man will become infected with the black mans germs my thought process is this if we allow separate but equal there is a chance that the equal part will not be enforced very diligently therefore in order to justify your belief in separate but equal you must explain what is wrong with allowing whites and colored people to eat at the same restaurant or sit next to one another on the bus whatever terrible thing it is that will happen to a white person who sits next to a black person on the bus will that same bad thing happen to a white person who sits next to another white person on the bus if you say no how do you figure plessey v ferguson was overturned in a case known as brown v board of education these days most of us are amazed that anyone would think that a white person using the same public restroom as a black person is inherently harmful 

fifty years ago most americans felt that gay people should not be allowed to marry and adopt now pretty much everyone who considers themselves liberal is in favor of extending full equal rights to homosexuals the percentage of republicans who oppose gay rights is becoming smaller by the year 

fifty years from now i am confident that those who oppose gay marriage will be seen the same way that people who oppose inter racial marriage are seen today these people will still exist but they will be a small minority of people and most of us will be amazed that anyone is or ever has been opposed to same sex marriage after all the purpose of laws is to protect people from harm that is not to say that just because a behavior has the potential to harm people that it should necessarily be illegal however only if a behavior is potentially harmful should it be illegal any and all behaviors that do not have the potential to harm people should be legal therefore laws stating that marriage licenses can only be issued to opposite sex couples and cannot be issued to same sex couples is fundamentally illogical for the same reason that it would be illogical to have a law prohibiting wearing a green shirt in public all the while it is totally legal to wear a red shirt in public anything whether it be good bad or neutral that could happen as a result of wearing a green shirt in public could also happen if you wear a red shirt in public therefore if the situation and context is such that you are allowed to wear a red shirt in public then you should be allowed to wear a green shirt in public similarly anything good bad or neutral that could happen if a same sex couple gets married could also happen if a sterile heterosexual couple gets married i added the qualifier that we are talking specifically about sterile heterosexual unions because same sex unions are 100 sterile while heterosexual unions do in fact carry with them the potential to create new life if being sterile does not preclude you from marrying someone of the opposite sex andor adopting a child then same sex couples should also be allowed to marry and adopt",bigelow6698,Liberal,12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1igl8pa/the_republican_party_appears_to_be_becoming_less/

2025-02-03 01:05:23,taxpayers are getting fleeced why arent our tax dollars treated like investments,"why is it that when taxpayers fund billiondollar corporations we dont get a single cent back but when corporations make billions off our investment they pay zero in taxes

why arent public funds treated as investments

every year billions of taxpayer dollars are poured into private enterprises massive corporate bailouts infrastructure projects pharmaceutical research hollywood film productions and sports stadiums the list goes on the justification economic stimulation job creation or public benefit but heres the problem while the corporations receiving this funding reap enormous profits taxpayers see little to no direct return on their investment most of the time were left footing the bill while public programs are struggling to keep afloat

if the government is acting as an investor then why isnt the public receiving dividends equity stakes or proportional profits why is taxpayer money being handed out with zero expectation of financial returns

this should not be a partisan issue its not socialism as i know many would call it nor do i see it as radical its basic investment logic and yet in every major taxpayerfunded venture the public is consistently left holding the bill while corporations rake in billions

the math behind social security an avoidable crisis

what really sparked this topic for me was a discussion i was having with my wife about social security one of the most glaring examples of our broken system right now there is a cap on how much income is subject to social security tax 176100 in 2025 this means that someone earning 176100 pays the exact same amount into social security as someone making 1 million 10 million or even 100 million

logically if this cap were removed high earners would contribute proportionally to their income and social securitys funding crisis would largely disappear in fact estimates suggest that simply taxing all income equally would extend social securitys solvency for decades

so why dont we do it because those with the most political influence high earners and corporations have successfully lobbied to keep this system in place ensuring that the burden falls disproportionately on middle and lowerincome workers

originally social security was supposed to function more like a longterm investment fund rather than a payasyougo system the original design intended for it to accumulate funds and generate returns over time instead the money was immediately spent on benefits and as a result weve been funding it through new contributions rather than investment growth

had we followed the originally intended formula instead of having certain global investment firms with trillions of dollars in investment capital driving up inflation wed have social security invested in our economy with that return ensuring future generations would be able to retire without worrying that theyll have to work until theyre gone

where public money goes and who profits

the problem isnt just social security taxpayer money is funneled into countless private enterprises with little to no accountability for returns here are just a few examples

1 corporate bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis the government bailed out banks with 700 billion in taxpayer money those banks quickly recovered and became massively profitable again but did the public receive a return on their forced investment no the banks pocketed the profits paid out executive bonuses and then raised fees on the customers who paid for their bailout this doesnt even count the car company bailouts or any of the other numerous other companies saved by taxpayer money
2 big pharma and governmentfunded research many of the worlds most profitable drugs were developed using taxpayerfunded research once these drugs hit the market pharmaceutical companies slap on astronomical price tags the public who funded the research not only has to pay full price but these companies often hike up prices on drugs they know that medicare and medicaid will pay for why arent these investments structured like venture capital deals where the government retains a percentage of profits you could probably fund medicare with just fair dividends from the drugs taxpayers have paid to research
3 hollywood and publicly funded productions millions of taxpayer dollars go into film tax credits militaryfunded productions and subsidized studio infrastructure yet when a film makes hundreds of millions in profit does the government receive a percentage absolutely not imagine if taxpayers had a stake in every blockbuster they funded proportionate to the tax dollars used to produce the film
4 stadium construction a perpetual public loss cities routinely shell out hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars to build sports stadiums under the false promise of economic growth in reality these projects generate mostly lowwage jobs with little tax revenue to justify the expense many of the employees at these stadiums make so little that they end up on medicaid and food stamps so i highly doubt even the few jobs they produce manage to create a positive tax flow meanwhile team owners often billionaires profit immensely and then a few decades later demand new taxpayerfunded stadiums instead of this endless cycle why arent cities demanding ownership stakes in these franchises it would be a better benefit to taxpayers if these downtown stadiums were used to build parking lots instead im not saying we shouldnt have sports teams but if were funding the stadiums and they have enough money to sign enormous contracts with athletes recently i saw one that was almost a billion dollars for one player then why on earth is there not enough money to repay the cost of the stadium at a bare minimum

a simple fair solution treat public spending like investment capital

if a venture capital firm invests in a startup they get equity if a bank loans money they demand collateral if the government taxpayers funds a project why is there no expectation of a financial return

a fair public investment strategy would include

 profit shares if public money funds 20 of a business the public should receive 20 of its net profits
 stock ownership if taxpayer dollars bail out a corporation the government should receive equity
 dividends for public programs profits from publicly funded projects should be reinvested into social security medicare and public infrastructure not funneled into executive bonuses

i absolutely do not see this as government overreach i see it as just common sense taxpayers should expect the same returns on investment that any private investor would demand taxpayerfunded programs have contributed greatly to the corporate side of the economy why is it acceptable that our tax dollars become their paychecks while very few of them contribute anything in the way of taxes

why this hasnt happened and how we change it

the only reason this system persists is because corporations have structured public spending to their advantage lobbyists ensure that taxpayer money keeps flowing with no strings attached while politicians many of whom engage in a form of legal insider trading benefit directly from protecting corporate interests

but this conversation needs to happen americans deserve to ask

 why are we funding billiondollar corporations with no expectation of return
 why do politicians resist removing the social security tax cap when it could fix the programs funding crisis
 why are taxpayerfunded investments structured as giveaways instead of longterm public assets
 why do we give money to corporations that dont pay taxes and are run by executives who also dont pay taxes when they give themselves the money we used to bail them out

if we demand accountability in public spending we could transform social security fund public programs without increasing taxes and finally break the cycle of corporate welfare disguised as economic policy

its time to start treating public investment like what it actually is an investment

lets face the truth these corporations rarely pay taxes there are so many tax loopholes out there that we dump billions of dollars into corporations that at the end of the year pay less taxes than the average employee at their own company

taking an equity stake in public investments is likely the only way taxpayers will ever see any return on public investment its important to recognize that were in deficit spending which means every dollar of corporate welfare is money we dont even have why do we allow our children and grandchildren to be born into debt ensuring executives are guaranteed generations of wealth for theirs

personally im sick of promises to tax the rich that in the end just end up creating inflation we pay for everywhere from the pump to the grocery store this is the only way i see corporations ever actually paying their fair share without it becoming just another expense that they will add their profit margins to and dump right back on us to pay for them

how much of wall street has been funded by taxpayers but only the wealthiest people and politicians make anything off it imagine if those companies had publicly appointed representatives on their boards similar to how governmentfunded agencies operate

how much of our infrastructure was taxpayerfunded but corporations make all the money off it

im sure many people can give countless more examples of taxpayer investments where the public saw no return

doesnt this seem like something that could be framed as a net positive for enough people on both sides of the aisle to make it happen eventually

trumps tariffs are the biggest tax on american consumers since the 1940s it will cost the average american at least 1000 dollars per year in consumption taxes without accounting for retaliatory effects we are both reducing our food supply workforce via deportation even of legal citizens and taxing the food supply via tariffs a double whammy on price increases and inflation not to mention he randomly poured out a large portion of californias water supply for quite literally no reason depleting the water available for our farmers this summer for irrigation 

canada is our countries biggest supplier of energy we are taxing that too we are taxing canada more than china who is the best positioned country to supplant us in global trade with both canada and the eu we are releasing cop beaters back into society and providing an unelected nongovernment official in elon musk who has significant business with and in china with our private citizens information on banking and addresses

trump has spent two weeks focused explicitly on crippling the american economy reducing our access to goods and services making the ones we do have access to more expensive and ensuring that things only get much worse from here conservatives meanwhile are whining and crying about democrats dei and people wanting to keep their bills down they are cheering on inflation government control of your personal information china and weakening of national security its truly baffling how much they are rooting against their own country",brewin91,Liberal,139,475,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ig954u/why_do_conservatives_hate_america/

 i get it to an extent seeing that things probably wont improve is tiring especially when you have little life experience to turn to for hope that things will get better its kind of like looking into the future and seeing a never ending hopeless pit it would be nice to have the ability to choose whether or not i want to live a traditional life  in my case it would be one partner stays at home with our future kids while the other works rather than having to work three jobs between my husband and i to pay off student loans and cost of living i have a bachelors and am a nurse and he is a fireman we also just live in an apartment and dont go out or anything with little to no savings 

however i do not understand why they think mass deportations tariffs taking away so many peoples rights and giving literally horrible people who only have their own best interests in mind all the power would help at all literally the only thing its destined to do is make our situation much worse plus so many people forgot how most of this was caused by the pandemic

2025-02-02 13:25:31,trump blames immigrants for housing pricesbut his own policies fueled the surge,"these are my thoughts on trumps impact on the housing market surge

the tax cuts and jobs act tcja of 2017 introduced a onetime mandatory repatriation tax on foreign earnings of us corporations leading to the repatriation of approximately 777 billion in 2018 this influx of capital resulted in significant share buybacks and dividend distributions providing substantial windfalls for investors many reinvested these gains into investment real estate fueling a buying frenzy that contributed to rapid property price increases additionally the number of investment properties and airbnb listings surged further intensifying competition in the housing market

during president trumps tenure the gross federal debt increased by about 78 trillion rising from 1995 trillion to 2775 trillion 

crfborg increase was due in part to the tcja and subsequent fiscal policies including covid19 relief measures

despite these factors former president trump has attributed the rise in housing market prices solely to increased immigration overlooking the significant impact of policies enacted during his administration 

trumps millionaire and billionaire friends have expanded their real estate empires while the average american struggles to afford a homeif they can at all instead were left renting from the 1 and now he claims hell fix the crisis by separating families framing himself as the savior of a problem his own policies helped create

so many times ive heard in rural communities that protesters are destroying their own cities or some variation of that 

50501 is planning on protesting in capitals where they hope to be seen and heard by legislators im guessing 



some questions

cities remain largely liberal rural areas arent what actual impact does protesting in a city have when the people there already largely agree 

what impact does protesting in front of a capital have when a lot of those legislators dont have to go to work arent voted in from that area and just wait it out 



im recommending a change of tactics 

guerrilla protesting rural areas  why not conservative agitators often go to cities to cause issues they arent always from those cities

i get that it can be harder to organize but its not impossible 

overwhelm smaller towns their police forces cant handle it and jails arent built for it town cops from nearby towns dont have jurisdiction

the first concentration camps to hold political opponents opened 2 months later germany was holding sham elections 8 months after that fascism is like life it comes at you fast

there have already been creepy parallels between the trump teams rhetoricactions and those of early nazi germany is it overreacting to take those parallels seriously perhaps but when it comes to potentially losing our democracy id rather pull the fire alarm too early than too late

this administration lives breathes and thrives off of that wretched network its the highest rated news network in the country literally every right wing politician in the country contributes to it the best way to stop a troll is to not give it any fuel for the fire and a lot of their hosts do nothing but trash other talk shows and anything else that doesnt fit murdochs mold 

the simple fact of the matter is that fox news is poison it has rotted as many if not more minds than the most dangerous street drugs out there doesnt matter which of their obnoxious hosts   if its hannity gutfeld ingraham baritromo and so on theyre just trolls they just feed and thrive off misery and chaos  particularly ours and the people they promote and get elected are nothing more than glorified content creators for that channel hell since taking office last monday trump has been on that channel like 5 times in the last week vance has been on it almost every day and everyone else connected to that administration is on it daily

so the best way to starve a troll  dont give them any fuel for the fire turn off fox just turn it off if we could put a dent in their ratings yeah it might not be much in the short run but hitting them repeatedly where it hurts could be a huge boost to our side in the long run turn off fox  turn it off at gyms turn it off at home turn it off at restaurants doctors offices offices everywhere its just a thought",G-Unit11111,Liberal,37,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ie61vb/an_idea_national_turn_off_fox_news_day/

she works in global health and development 2ish days ago they froze all foreign aid funding for an audit audits are normal but freezing it in the meantime is not not only that they froze funding that was already allocatedpromised nonprofits will spend that money on credit as soon as its allocated meaning several are already folding and declaring bankruptcy almost everyone she knows in the field have been laid off or put on leave theyre freaking the fuck out as now the entire industry they work in is faltering and theres no way to find a new job until this is resolved if its resolved

luckily my parents are moving to london for a few years in the next month and shell be able to get a job there thats not affected by the us government but this freeze means employees in other countriesmany of whom are the breadwinners for their familiesare abruptly out of work

it could happen someday that trump steps down due to age or he gets removed from office for being mentally unfit from your point of view would you prefer trump to stay or vance to take over

im aware there are two schools of thought here some want the republicans to run the country well others want them to do a poor job so they arent voted in next time

trump has the extremely strong following but a tendency to do what he wants including doing and saying damaging things that alienate his team and sometimes even voters but he doesnt seem to care too much about project 2025

vance is more competent and seems more closely aligned with project 2025 than trump but he doesnt have the popularity trump does with the public and perhaps not with trumps allies  
his wife is a hindu woman of indian ethnicity and this alienates him from racist people on the far right

they said oh dont be ridiculous he needs congress to do anything project 25 is just liberal fear mongering   deportations  are just hypotheticals

well they arent hypotheticals now he stopped funds without congress and where are the anti war voters now that hes threatening our allies

they chose to either not vote or vote trump democrats did earn their vote by promising to defend what trump has been destroying in a week

harris promised to protect unions trump promised to bust them

harris promised to protect civil rights trump just killed it

how was keeping the status quo of our rights worse or the same than their total erasure

they chose trump or decided to let him win over their own interests  thats not the democrats fault

i think the only thing the democrats should be criticized about is thinking a woman was going to win most of america is too sexist and its a reality we need to accept

saying she was cringe or accusing her of lecturing them really is code 

and stop with the lie biden promised to be one term an aide suggested he might biden himself never said it

but we cant keep defending these people they are complicit and need to realize it otherwise they learned nothing like they did in 2016

2025-01-28 17:00:08,linkedin protest and action,"please consider participating in a protest on linkedin  linkedin hosts an international mixed audience with influence and money  corporate government and religious bodies are exposed  a considerable fraction of its users are sympathetic  over the past few days i did a test run and had some success  i did not see much concurrent resistance activity but there is quite a bit of existing political discussion

i began with my authentic linkedin profile  i have worked as a us engineer for a few companies and had around 500 contacts  i do not think linkedin is particularly useful for career purposes and have not been very active

i believe my most successful tactic was targeting company posts  as an example many companies with millions of followers made posts celebrating mlk jr day  on these i commented company name ceo name what is your opinion on musks nazi salute  i then liked the company post and reposted it to my account with the same comment as a description

i also commented on a few corporate disclosures  as an example a germany company posted a video where the ceo talked about political changes improving business prospects  i wrote something about these policies being similar to those of the afd and asked whether he supported elon musks salute  i happened to be the first commenter and believe many people saw this  individuals with inside and industry knowledge could gather considerable attention in this way

i interacted with both conservative and progressive commenters  many of my statements were upvoted or argued  i am not sure how effective this was but it is somewhat visible

i posted a few news articles  i am not sure how effective this is because it was hard to get impressions

a few people complained that my behavior was not work appropriate but i think most users are in favor of free speech

over about three days i accumulated about 300 profile views and 4000 impressions  some very influential people with job titles like vp and chief communications officer viewed my profile  people from all over the world viewed my profile  a royal liked one of my comments  women seemed particularly sympathetic and courageous  this was a test run and i am not particularly well versed in social media

it is possible to directly post articles videos and reddit content  i think it is possible to generate fake accounts with nothing more than an email  someone named elon musk with a picture of elon musk liked a comment

this morning i woke up to find that my account had been suspended  it took them 3 days to do this and i suspect they can be overwhelmed  the email indicates that this is due to potential identity theft  i was asked to provide images of government identification to restore access  i do not know if my account will be restored

i also received one warning for hate speech  this warning threatened potential account suspension  i had written fuck trump  i do not think this is hate speech  this comment was up for something like 15 days before i received the warning  using language like fascist and nazi may or may not be recommended but i was very aggressive

2025-01-28 12:57:02,something that isnt talked about enough,"how insane it is that trump is president again 

the biggest focal point here is january 6th he was impeached a second time for that and had been convicted of crimes and conservatives still wanted him and only him out of all the republican candidates also for a party that preaches law and order wheres the law and order in even letting trump run again im also looking at you scotus for giving trump immunity 

society somehow doesnt think its messed up that you could be convicted of felonies and be eligible to hold the highest office theres no standards for how presidents are as people anymore its to the point that me posting this in any sub not dedicated to liberals would at least lead to some comments about how stupid i am

democratic politicians set a good example during the vote counting process by not disputing the election results nor telling people to fight like hell telling them if you dont fight were not gonna have a country anymore etc

people would say well look at what this former president did and what that president did has any president or presidential candidate ever strongly and so openly disputed election results then told their supporters to storm the capitol which led to their own vp almost being killed

i blindly assumed that trump was done for after j6 because i thought the law would take care of him well in a way they did but he somehow was still allowed to run again and he still got just as much support as he did 8 years ago

the name tea party was genius because it linked so nicely to the boston tea party  im not smart enough to think up something similar  but certainly someone in the reddit world is

the tea party was all about reining in presidential power and government in general  every time obama signed an executive order the right went freaking nuts

up is now officially down  we should be taking advantage of that

edit to add  lots of but this and but that replies  however this post has 90 approval  this isnt a perfect idea  but we seem to agree that something effective needs to happen

how about the king movement  it came to me after monkeyangst pointed out that maga folks misspell rein in as reign in  we could literally use it

king links us to dr mlk jr  who created great change peacefully  it also reminds people that if we dont do something quick we are doomed to be ruled by the rich  

amconmichael pointed out that the tea party was really an anti black president party   i agree  their stated purpose was to push back against too much government power  we have the same stated purpose but technically we would be an anti orange president party  

brodievonorchard pointed out that the tea party was quickly astroturfed by the oil baron koch bro pricks  true  and big oil is still big shit  but if the tea partys true purpose was to thwart a black president then didnt that exact scenario just happen  

fitz2112b points out that the tea party morphed into maga  which is now a faceeating leopard oligarchy  true  are we saying that with the threat of astroturfing and leopardfaceeating maybe we shouldnt go there

 but  we arent out numbered at all

by the numbers  
us population  335 million

roughly 73 million people under the age of 18 
roughly 160 million registered voters in the country

total votes cast in 2024 1523 million 8 million didnt show up 

trump won by 22 million

so 
335 million people minus those under 18 
minus the people who did vote is  

thats about 100 million people who are eligible to but not registered to vote

that means there are approx 108 million people right there who arent registered active or paying attention and you know of those 108 million  theyre certainly not all trump supporters 

and  77ish million people voted from trump that number is a scant 23 of our total population its still too high of course but let me say that again  twentythree per cent 

so take heart all is not lost and we are not out umbered the media wants us to think we are doomed we absolutely are not but  somehow the folks who have tuned it all out need to be activated somehow 

frankly  im daring to have a modicum of hope for midterms  but it is gonna be a long fucking two years 

 i just peeked at arizona and trump won the vote by a measly 200k i imagine theres a quarter million out of 7mill people in az that think he sucks doncha think

2025-01-25 23:37:25,the new era of selfeducation,"tldr what are some of the most impactful books youve read that debunked the myths you were told in school

with trump changing course syllabi  i have never felt more strongly about the power of selfeducation

more than ever i feel it is my duty to read books books from those of us who are outliers in society those of us who tell history not as his story but as a true and full story of the events that unfolded

the things we learn in schools they are not a beall endall of knowledge the breadth and depth of the things we learn in school is widely censored carefully scripted to fit the narratives of the board of directors and institution administrators many of whom are conservative in their own right

there were many myths i learned in school that took time to debunk and the debunking did not come from textbook history books they came from independent historians with a vision to share the truth the whole truth the good the bad the ugly

ps 

the angel who arrived to share the joyous news of jesus christs birth chose to appear in front of a group of shepherds who at the time were outcasts cursed to the outskirts of the city where they tended their flocks and slept under the night sky

even though jesus had arrived to save the world he was born in a lowly manger birthed in a bed of hay  he spent his life healing the weak and uplifting the poor the disenfranchised the ones marginalized from society 

so many of our leaders leaders who threaten to take away rights freeze or fire jobs and allow the destruction of corporate greed to degrade the planet use christianity as the flame for their fire 

and perhaps many of us voted in thinking they stood for the ideologies they preached but its only after i read the bible as someone not born into christianity having never gone to church or communion that i understood jesus mission thats the power of selfeducation 

btw im only using jesus here because many of us are christian and may relate better to his story but ive also enjoyed reading texts from the bhagavad gita quran pali cannon and torah",In4thelongrun_,Liberal,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ia0ce9/the_new_era_of_selfeducation/

2025-01-22 20:14:12,contradictory conservatives a call for reflection,"im not deeply entrenched in politics nor do i hate conservatives or maga supporters as a group i prefer to judge individuals based on their character and actions that said ive observed what feels like a significant transformation within the conservative movement over the past 16 years

in the 2000s the republican party seemed to stand on foundational principlesissues like abortion gun control government overreach and border security these principles while debatable were often presented with a degree of respect and thoughtfulness the rise of trump however ushered in a new era of conservatism it feels more aggressive less tethered to intellectual consistency and more pervasive in our daily lives thanks in part to platforms like youtube tiktok facebook and instagram

this increased exposure has prompted me to examine conservative ideologies more critically alongside their liberal counterparts through logical reasoning and exploring potential contradictions ive identified some striking paradoxes within the modern conservative movement while these arent novel insights i hope to open a dialogue for further exploration and understanding

the prolife paradox

conservatives frequently champion a zerotolerance approach to abortion they argue that life begins at conception and that a fetus regardless of development stage has an inalienable right to life for many this belief is rooted in a sincere desire to protect innocent life on its surface this seems noble even compelling most people regardless of political affiliation would agree that lateterm abortionsexcept in extreme casesshould be restricted

yet conservatives apply this logic inconsistently if the moral imperative to protect life is so absolute why is there no parallel outcry to address the leading cause of death among children and teenagers in the usguns conservatives cling to the second amendment as if its untouchable yet their unwillingness to consider even modest reforms stands in stark contrast to their selfprofessed commitment to protecting life

this inconsistency deepens when we examine their position on the future of the very fetuses they fight to save imagine a fetus they protect today grows up into a woman facing an unwanted pregnancyperhaps due to assault health risks or financial instability the same conservatives who fought for her right to be born would now deny her autonomy forcing her to carry a pregnancy to term regardless of the consequences

if the prolife movement truly values life why isnt there a push for universal prek affordable childcare or free school lunch programs where is the investment in the wellbeing of american youth instead we see an intense focus on banning drag show readings while programs that directly benefit children languish

this raises the question do conservatives truly value life or is their interest in protecting the unborn merely a means to exert control over personal freedoms

the trump contradiction

trumps presidency and influence have brought contradictions within the conservative movement into sharp focus for instance conservatives cheered trumps recent executive order to repeal electric vehicle mandates celebrating his commitment to oil and gas yet the advisor he tapped for this initiative is the ceo of the worlds largest electric vehicle manufacturer how does this align with their narrative

consider trumps actions on tiktok in 2020 he signed an executive order to ban the app citing national security concerns over chinese ownership conservatives rallied behind him lauding his toughness on china fast forward to today and tiktoks reinstatement is celebrated as a victory for free speech conveniently forgotten is trumps role in the original ban as is the fact that a major american investor in tiktok is one of his donors

the contradictions extend to immigration one of trumps hallmark issues in february 2024 a bipartisan border bill was proposed the legislation would have tightened asylum standards and automatically secured the border if illegal crossings exceeded certain thresholds trump however opposed the bill calling it a gift to the democrats following his condemnation senate republicans abandoned it and the bill failed conservatives who revere trump as the ultimate defender of the border have remained silent about his role in blocking legislation that could have reduced illegal immigration

the larger question

these are just a few examples of what i see as glaring contradictions within the conservative movement how can conservatives reconcile being prolife while disregarding the lives of pregnant women children and teens killed by gun violence how do they explain supporting a president whose actions often undermine the very principles they claim to hold dear

i dont ask these questions to inflame or mock but to encourage meaningful dialogue i want to hear from you share your thoughts provide your perspectives and help deepen this conversation perhaps together we can untangle the inconsistencies and better understand the ideological shifts at play

2025-01-22 20:12:46,the dred scott case has no relevance to the second amendment,"its my understanding that gun advocates sometimes use the 1857 dred scott v sandford link decision to make the argument that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns  just a few examples of 2a advocates making this argument are this video this video and this video as well as written examples such as these link 1 link 2 link 3  in fact even justice clarence thomas connects dred scott to the second amendment in his opinion for nysrpa vs bruen link  most of their argument seems to stem from this excerpt from the opinion in that case written by chief justice roger brooke taney

gtmore especially it cannot be believed that the large slaveholding states regarded them as included in the word citizens or would have consented to a constitution which might compel them to receive them in that character from another state for if they were so received and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety it would give to persons of the negro race who were recognised as citizens in any one state of the union the right to enter every other state whenever they pleased singly or in companies without pass or passport and without obstruction to sojourn there as long as they pleased to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak to hold public meetings upon political affairs and to keep and carry arms wherever they went and all of this would be done in the face of the subject race of the same color both free and slaves and inevitably producing discontent and insubordination among them and endangering the peace and safety of the state

the portion ive put in bold appears to be what some argue is a synopsis of the federal bill of rights and the statement saying and to keep and carry arms wherever they went appears to be a reference to the second amendment  gun advocates would argue that if the supreme court in 1857 believed that the second amendment guaranteed a citizen an individual right to keep and carry a gun then this must also have been the traditional and authentic interpretation of that amendment

however i dont understand how this argument is valid  it seems to me that one could only come to the aforementioned conclusion if one has not actually read the context in which the above paragraph appears  earlier justice taney had begun his opinion by presenting a list of state laws which placed explicit restrictions upon the rights and privileges of the black populations of the respective states  these laws dated from colonial times through to the thenpresent day  taneys reasoning was essentially that it made no sense for a negro that was a slave or a descendant of slaves imported from africa to become a citizen because the sum of all of the discriminatory and prohibitive laws that had been passed against the black populations strongly indicates that it had been the general will of the individual states to subjugate the black populations in the interest of public peace and security  and when the individual states ratified the constitution in order to join into a union under a federal government the individual states vested to the federal government the protection of their peace and safety and thus it would be inappropriate for the federal government to betray this trust by giving citizenship to a demographic which the individual states themselves had seen fit to subjugate  

 among the list of discriminatory laws he mentions the first is a 1717 law from maryland which declared

gtthat if any free negro or mulatto intermarry with any white woman or if any white man shall intermarry with any negro or mulatto woman such negro or mulatto shall become a slave during life excepting mulattoes born of white women who for such intermarriage shall only become servants for seven years to be disposed of as the justices of the county court where such marriage so happens shall think fit to be applied by them towards the support of a public school within the said county and any white man or white woman who shall intermarry as aforesaid with any negro or mulatto such white man or white woman shall become servants during the term of seven years and shall be disposed of by the justices as aforesaid and be applied to the uses aforesaid

 then he mentions a 1705 massachusetts law which declared that

gtif any negro or mulatto shall presume to smite or strike any person of the english or other christian nation such negro or mulatto shall be severely whipped at the discretion of the justices before whom the offender shall be convicted

 and another law from the same state declares

gtthat none of her majestys english or scottish subjects nor of any other christian nation within this province shall contract matrimony with any negro or mulatto nor shall any person duly authorized to solemnize marriage presume to join any such in marriage on pain of forfeiting the sum of fifty pounds one moiety thereof to her majesty for and towards the support of the government within this province and the other moiety to him or them that shall inform and sue for the same in any of her majestys courts of record within the province by bill plaint or information

 he later on mentions a 1774 connecticut provision

gtby which any negro indian or mulatto servant who was found wandering out of the town or place to which he belonged without a written pass such as is therein described was made liable to be seized by anyone and taken before the next authority to be examined and delivered up to his master  who was required to pay the charge which had accrued thereby and a subsequent section of the same law provides that if any free negro shall travel without such pass and shall be stopped seized or taken up he shall pay all charges arising thereby and this law was in full operation when the constitution of the united states was adopted and was not repealed till 1797 so that up to that time free negroes and mulattoes were associated with servants and slaves in the police regulations established by the laws of the state

 and then another connecticut law in 1833 which

gtmade it penal to set up or establish any school in that state for the instruction of persons of the african race not inhabitants of the state or to instruct or teach in any such school or institution or board or harbor for that purpose any such person without the previous consent in writing of the civil authority of the town in which such school or institution might be

 justice taney mentions a provision in new hampshire  in 1815 in which

gtno one was permitted to be enrolled in the militia of the state but free white citizens and the same provision is found in a subsequent collection of the laws made in 1855 nothing could more strongly mark the entire repudiation of the african race the alien is excluded because being born in a foreign country he cannot be a member of the community until he is naturalized but why are the african race born in the state not permitted to share in one of the highest duties of the citizen the answer is obvious he is not by the institutions and laws of the state numbered among its people he forms no part of the sovereignty of the state and is not therefore called on to uphold and defend it

 and finally he mentions an 1822 rhode island law

gtforbidding persons who were authorized to join persons in marriage from joining in marriage any white person with any negro indian or mulatto under the penalty of two hundred dollars and declaring all such marriages absolutely null and void and the same law was again reenacted in its revised code of 1844 so that down to the lastmentioned period the strongest mark of inferiority and degradation was fastened upon the african race in that state

 it is after his list of such restrictive and discriminatory laws that justice taney extrapolates that if it was the will of the states to exclude the black population from the status of citizenship within each of their respective dominions then it is only appropriate that the same demographic be excluded from citizenship by the national government into which the respective states had vested their collective interests  as taney states

gtfor if they were so received and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety

 and then it is here where taney states the excerpt which progun advocates so often emphasize

gtit would give to persons of the negro race who were recognised as citizens in any one state of the union the right to enter every other state whenever they pleased singly or in companies without pass or passport and without obstruction to sojourn there as long as they pleased to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak to hold public meetings upon political affairs and to keep and carry arms wherever they went

upon looking at the larger context of this excerpt it would seem that the excerpt doesnt actually mean what the progun advocates interpret it to mean  first of all it would seem that some of the items within this excerpt correlate with the prohibitive laws previously mentioned  the first is when he mentions the right to enter every other state whenever they pleased    without pass or passport      this correlates with the aforementioned 1774 connecticut provision that required people of color to carry a pass when wandering outside the town of their residence  and the second correlated item is  in my interpretation  the infamous line and to keep and carry arms wherever they went   i understand this line to be an allusion to the 1815 new hampshire law which limited the right of militia duty to only free white citizens of the state   

gunrights advocates would likely interpret the latter line to refer to the text of the second amendment and to refer to an individual right to own and carry guns for private purposes such as self defense or sport  however it makes no sense for the line to keep and carry arms wherever they went to refer to the text of the second amendment  even though this line may sound similar to the line the right of the people to keep and bear arms they are not the same and the differences between the two are not at all negligible  first of all the second amendment refers to the right to bear arms while the line from dred scott says carry arms  the modern reader may simply see these two phrases as synonymous but they are not  the meaning of carry arms is straightforward consisting of a transitive verb acting upon a noun but the phrase bear arms does not actually refer to the carrying of arms but rather is itself a phrasal verb and an idiomatic expression  according to the oxford english dictionary  the most authoritative resource on the english language  the expression bear arms originated around ad 1325 and is correlated with the latin phrase arma ferre likely being simply a direct translation of the latin  also according to the oxford english dictionary the phrase is defined simply as to serve as a soldier to fight for a country cause etc  the sense of the phrase the right to bear arms in the sense that progun advocates typically use the phrase is according to the oxford dictionary an originally and chiefly american redefinition of the phrase originating circa 1776  hence the second amendment references the right of the people to keep arms and to fight andor serve as a soldier while the dred scott line instead references the right to keep arms and carry arms  

furthermore the dred scott line also differs from the second amendment by including the modifier wherever they went  no such modifier exists in the second amendment  in fact the second amendment is merely a prohibitive provision one which is applied against congress itself and does not directly apply any affirmative granting of rights to the people  it makes no sense to interpret an absolute prohibition against congress as somehow establishing a modified affirming of rights to the people  because of these linguistic and textual details it is at best quite a stretch to claim that the phrase and to keep and carry arms wherever they went is somehow a meaningful reference to the second amendment

some might alternatively argue that the line rather than referring to the text of the second amendment specifically is instead referring to the liberty of private gun use in general  but what makes much more sense is that the line and to keep and carry arms wherever they went instead of referring to private gun use actually refers to militia duty  it was customary in early america for militiamen to possess arms  such as muskets or rifles  in their personal custody ie to keep arms and to literally carry them wherever they went  we can see evidence of this from numerous militiarelated laws from early america from colonial times until the 20th century  on example is a new york law from 1640

and here are a few more links to other similar militia laws

1786 new hampshire

1631 virginia

1632 virginia

1642 virginia

so it would seem that with a deeper understanding of the workings of the militia during early american history the modifier wherever they went should more sensibly be correlated with the common practices surrounding compulsory militia service rather than being correlated with any sort of voluntary liberty of carrying arms for private purposes  

the connection that the progun community makes between dred scott and the second amendment is tenuous at best  within the passage in bold from dred scott there are four stated civil rights the right to travel freely without a pass the right to freedom of speech the right to hold public meetings on political issues and the right to keep and carry arms  of these four rights only one of them can be said to correlate directly to the bill of rights the right of freedom of speech  the rest have no connection to the bill of rights  and to assume that the phrase to keep and carry arms is directly related to the second amendment is a stretch since the language between the two statements has only a superficial correlation  these stated civil rights in bold do not represent the contents of the bill of rights and thus cannot be interpreted as a general reference to that document and the phrase to keep and carry arms wherever they went does not represent the second amendment directly for these reasons there is simply no argument that this passage from dred scott supports second amendment rights   

of the four stated civil rights it would appear that justice taney mentions two of them as allusions to previously mentioned statutes the line and to keep and carry arms wherever they went correlates to the aforementioned 1815 new hampshire militia law which excluded black people from militia service and an even more obvious connection is made between the line the right to enter every other state whenever they pleased    without pass or passport and the 1774 connecticut law requiring black people to carry a pass while traveling  

the other two stated civil rights  freedom of speech and the right to hold public meetings  appear to be outliers of this pattern as they appear to have been mentioned without any aforementioned precedent in state law  however there might still be a particular reason why justice taney saw fit to mention these particular rights  it so happens that most of the items listed in the bolded excerpt are also stipulated in the declaration of rights in the 1820 missouri state constitution  this is especially relevant since the dred scott case centered on whether the plaintiff was still considered a slave in the slave state of missouri after having gained his freedom after traveling to the free state of illinois  notably the two outlier items are also addressed in the missouri constitution

the statement from dred scott which says and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak appears to correlate with article 13 clause 16

gtthat the free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man and that every person may freely speak write and print on any subject being responsible for the abuse of that liberty

 and the statement to hold public meetings upon political affairs appears to correlate with article 13 clause 2

gtthat the people of this state have the inherent sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof and of altering and abolishing their constitution and form of government whenever it may be necessary to their safety and happiness

furthermore in addition to their connection to the discriminatory laws already established within the text of dred scott the remaining two items from the excerpt also appear to have correlates in the missouri constitution as well  the statement about the right of a citizen to enter every other state whenever they pleased appears to correlate with a clause in article 3 section 26

gtit shall be their the general assemblys duty as soon as may be to pass such laws as may be necessary1 to prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling in this state under any pretext whatsoever

 and it also seems to correlate with article 13 clause 21

gt that migration from this state cannot be prohibited

and the statement and to keep and carry arms wherever they went appears to correlate with the state arms provision in part of article 13 clause 3

gtthat their right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the state cannot be questioned

compared to the second amendment this arms provision in the missouri constitution seems more pertinent to the arms statement mentioned in the dred scott decision since this provision specifically qualifies the lawful purposes for which the right to bear arms may be exercised which the second amendment does not do

conclusion

some might say that it only makes sense that justice taney is referring to the federal bill of rights in the bolded excerpt because he is speaking on behalf of the united states supreme court which is a federal body  however this interpretation is uninformed  when we look at the actual context of the dred scott decision it is clear that the particular point that justice taney is making in that excerpt pertains much more to state law than to federal law  even though the decision that justice taney is making is a federal decision he is clearly making this federal decision based on state premises

it has never been the primary prerogative of the federal government to grant rights to american citizens  it is state governments that have the primary authority and function of specifying and granting civil rights  hence justice taney wasnt saying that making black people into citizens  at the federal level  would give them rights his point was that federally making black people into citizens would effectively negate the prohibitive laws that the states have established in order to subjugate their black populations  in other words making black people into citizens would create a kind of double negative whose effect is a positive it would not actually give them anything but instead would take away the laws that take away their liberties  the verbiage it would give to persons of the negro race is hence metaphorical rather than literal  its like if a judge were to exonerate a convicted prison inmate through dna evidence the judge isnt actually giving the inmate his freedom the judge is just removing his incarceration  thus it is merely the result of a quirk of language and rhetoric that justice taney appears to be affirming that american citizens are entitled to the liberty to keep and carry arms wherever they go  but for gun advocates to take this rhetoric literally as they often do is simply a wrong conclusion to draw

as for the content of the bolded excerpt i cant say how purposeful or how arbitrary this particular assortment of rights was meant to be  at least two of the four items appear to be references to state laws which he had previously referenced yet he breaks this pattern with the other two items which do not have any statutory precursor in dred scott and there are even more state laws referenced earlier that he does not allude to in the bolded list  and furthermore all of the items in the list could be said to have correlates in the 1820 missouri constitution but it is not clear whether justice taney was actually alluding to that constitution in particular  because of its relevance to the case at hand or if he was referencing any other state constitution  in summary i dont know exactly why justice taney chose the particular list of items that he chose in the bolded excerpt of his majority opinion in dred scott however i can say with much more confidence what this excerpt does not indicate  he is not referencing the federal bill of rights as a whole he is not referencing the second amendment in particular and he is likely not referencing the general liberty of private firearm rights  therefore there is no basis for progun advocates to use this case as a means to argue for firearm rights

dark times are ahead and we must resist them lest societys privileges are enjoyed only by card carrying magats and the words usa become scorned and despised like nazi by future generations around the world we who do so are true to the vision of americas founding fathers not those loudmouthed gun brandishing flag waving self proclaimed patriots of the right who want their freedoms at the expense of others

we also know a republican controlled congress no matter how slim and trumps presidency will undoubtedly make things much harder for a lot of people no matter what state you live in when this comes will people rely more on those protections and programs that blue states have will they decide that it is worth moving out of red states in favor of blue states since there isnt a federal government that will protect them will there be an awakening to the importance of state government and how will all this affect the next election",Ashamed-Complaint423,Liberal,66,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1i1rs4r/will_this_election_cause_a_shift_in_population/

ive noticed his content tends to gaslight people into thinking we are overreacting when we say stuff like homophobia misogyny and racism are still current issues and some right wing voters immediately shut that idea down because of the equal rights everyone in america has they seem to believe the homophobiaracism is just petty discourse online and isnt really as big of an issue as we make it out to be because we arent  in the 1900s anymore and everyone is equal

i want to refer to something i learnt in history class called the five stages of isolation which is basically a progression of actions leading to mass genocide by hitler and many other cruel dictators from the past the first stage was bias attitude second was act of bias third was systemic discrimination fourth was bias motivated violence and fifth was obviously genocide 

to the conservatives the discrimination minorities face might just be nothing in todays day and age but it can quickly progress to mass genocide just like it did in germany japan etc 

like its already at level 4 and thats why minorities are so scared man like i dont understand why ppl just love to disregard peoples experiences and say they r overreacting the main victims of this argument is actually women cus people love to use that what rights do women in america not have argument

right now they are blaming the fires on democrat leadership my guess is that the conservatives who now basically run the gop will find a conservative candidate to run for governor in 2026 this candidate will no doubt be endorsed by trump 

once trump officially takes office i expect comer and jordan to launch the first investigation of the year against newsom and the mayor of la a black female democrat it will be a show trial that doesnt solve anything the main purpose is to make the people of california think the democrats are idiots if it works is a different story

but what do you all think should we all quit meta i mean ive been wanting to reduce my time spent on social media for a while now and all that anyway and these latest decisions could absolutely be justification i finally needed i certainly dont like the idea that me eyeballs are generating any revenue for zuckerberg i already dropped twitter for bluesky a while ago so one way of looking it is we should take the high road and just exitmeta and when this news first broke that was my first instinct i posted statuses saying i was leaving and that everyone could find me on bluesky deleted the apps off my phone did all that

but another way to look at it is that thats letting them win theres been a lot of talk about how one of the big reasons that republicans keep winning elections is that theyre winning the information war somehow despite us supposedly being the party of young smart and tech savvy people theyve beat us at the online misinformation game we can have a totally completely different discussion on why that is what we could have done differently but its true so maybe we shouldnt quit meta maybe now its up to us to double down and fight there to all dedicate some time to add these community notes that theyre going to use instead to make sure that actual real news gets liked and shared as much as possible plus a lot of my local activist organizations still use ig as their primary way of organizing maybe some will move to bluesky or something else but so far i havent seen a huge exit by them or anything


update a majority of these replies have either been i never joined or i quit years ago which kind of speaks to my biggest concern if none of us are on social media to combat misinformation then more people young people fresh voters will be exposed to it and radicalized i was really shocked about how much trump improved with young and first time voters but once you realize they get most of their information from instagram and tiktok and weve all abandoned those platforms with our typical scoldy judgemental attitude towards them and people that still use them what did we think was going to happen",TaylorHu,Liberal,239,241,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1i0r2k4/are_you_all_quitting_meta/

for example its considered ok as a woman to be fearful and ignore a man in public if he comes up to ask for the time or directions but if this same action was done because somebody was black it would be considered racist 

if a woman directs anger at men for harnessing rape culture its considered ok but if somebody said that black people harness gangster culture it would be considered racist 

if a woman hates men in general because of being assaulted by one its considered ok by society but if somebody hates black people because they were assaulted by a black person its considered racist

2025-01-10 19:19:58,the us judicial system has failed,"the purpose of the judicial system was to ensure that no person is above the law and that the court andor judges are not prejudicial towards anybody simply based on elected office the ending of trumps first election interference case has officially proved that notion false no president had ever tested the limits of presidential immunity like this and it is now proven that a president is given leniencies for their crimes putting a potential 4 year sentencing to zero not a fine not community service zero the fact that a sentencing even took place today was a surprise to just about everybody especially since it was revealed that sc justice alito had a personal phone call with trump the day before trump requested a delay in sentencing with the supreme court

 what trump has been allowed to get away with just since he has left office has completely broken the judicial system he was allowed to use stall tactics with no merits again and again and again while the judges just kept going along with it held in contempt 10 times for violating gag orders posting about the judge their family the jury etc as the prosecutor put it trump was relentless in his attacks on the cases all parties involved and even the rule of law itself he has done irreparable damage to how the law is viewed and how it is applied and he was able to do all of this while not being president meaning as an expresident he was given extreme leniencies that allowed him to go 6 months after conviction to sentencing this is as far as i know unprecedented even in new york city 

on the bigger scale trump was convicted of election interference creating a plan to prevent information from being released that would impact the electio and falsifying business records to hide it all the evidence is overwhelming and decisive what to speak of all of the evidence in his multiple other criminal cases and now he is presidentelect and we all have to pretend none of that exists anymore because he won a popularity contest 

throughout all of the court proceedings for the criminal activities of trump he has always argued presidential immunity even if it is clearly not in the official scope of presidential immunity so clearly there is an unofficial scope of presidential immunity that might just be up to the discretion of the judge but then of course that leads us to the highest court in the land an unelected board of appointed judges that for the long foreseeable future have been shaped by the felon convicted of election interference and still currently on trial for more election interference across multiple jurisdictions",Icy_Statement_2410,Liberal,79,306,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1hycg5k/the_us_judicial_system_has_failed/

2025-01-07 18:23:00,would you support the wyoming rule,"as of 2024 if you live in wyoming your vote carries about 37 times more weight in the presidential election than if you live in california this disparity arises because each electoral vote ev in wyoming represents approximately 194690 people while each ev in california represents about 721670 people

i still think that the national popular vote should be determining the presidency regardless of which party benefits the common argument against thisthat cities like new york or los angeles would dominate electionsdoesnt really hold much weight in reality only about 329 of the us votingage population resides in the ten largest metro areas even if every single person in these metro areas voted the same way which they dont and wouldnt the remaining 671 of the electorate still holds substantial influence

while the electoral college is unlikely to be abolished i think it should be adjusted to better reflect where people actually live one potential solution is the wyoming rule which proposes increasing the size of the us house of representatives so that the representativetopopulation ratio aligns with the smallest statecurrently wyoming this adjustment would redistribute electoral votes more fairly

california  71 ev 33

texas  53 ev 34

florida  39 ev 32



rhode island  4 ev 0

vermont  3 ev 0

wyoming  3 ev 0

total  538 gt 677 32

would you support a reform like this it doesnt inherently benefit one party over another it simply makes votes more equal across states

in fact using the 2024 presidential election under this new system

2025-01-06 02:27:01,putin trump musk  whos the biggest threat to the world lets rank them,"heres my take on who poses the greatest threat to the world and why

3 trump  the easily manipulated narcissist

		a narcissistic idiot but the key difference is that hes not strategiche just reacts

		easily influenced by whoever flatters him the most at any given moment

		no real ideologyjust selfinterest which makes him unpredictable but also limits his effectiveness

		the danger comes from his enablers think bannon maga extremists and billionaire backers who use him as a tool

		would absolutely hand over ukraine to putin when he got back in office just to feel like a deal maker

 threat level high but mostly because of the people around him

2 musk  the tech billionaire with too much 
power 

		another narcissistic idiot but unlike trump he actually controls powerful global infrastructure starlink ai twitterx

		shifts opinions constantlyone day hes proukraine the next hes practically reciting kremlin talking points

		not ideological just egodrivenhe craves being worshiped and will adapt his views to whatever makes him feel important

		biggest danger he owns tools that shape wars elections yet hes reckless and impulsive

 threat level higher than trump because he has more realworld power and even less accountability

1 putin  the calculated threat

		unlike trump and musk putin is not an idiothes a highfunctioning narcissist with a longterm strategy

		he knows exactly what hes doing and plays the long game with brutality and precision

		has directly started wars committed war crimes and openly threatens nuclear conflict

		not just a danger to democracy but to global stability his entire goal is to destabilize the west so russia can gain more power

		the most dangerous because he is willing to kill and destroy on a mass scale and hes good at it

 threat level 1 by far unlike the other two he has an actual plan and its terrifying

final ranking of danger

 1 putin  ruthless intelligent and willing to burn the world down

 2 musk  reckless unstable and dangerously influential

 3 trump  dumb easily manipulated and dangerous mostly because of his enablers

2024-12-31 00:52:25,questions about symbols freedom of speech nationalism,"apologies in advance for the rant 
for as long as i can remember ive been a big fan of the fact that the the us enshrined free speech in the constitution  one of the few things i still find to be proud of here we still mostly let people express themselves how they want  as such ive also been very wary of people who want to use the power of the government or even social pressure to punish speech and certain kinds of expression that make them feel icky or doesnt agree with whatever theyve had on a loop in their heads for the last 60 years  i find fewer examples of those people scarier than the flag fanatics  nationalism has been alive and well in the us for a long time but it just keeps growing like some kind of swollen idiocy cancer  its frightening because it seems so pervasive so obviously the opposite of the freedom of the individual that is central to the american ideal and yet so many of our own citizens are so poorly educated in civics and basic logic and critical thinking that they dont see the conflict between individual freedom and laws that regulate speech or even their own insistence that my type of expression is protected but yours isnt  all over the us people have american flags on display all year round sometimes lots of them  flags are fine theyre symbolic communication its a symbol of something important to the person who hung it up  but with the american flag then there are the rules that come with it  there are a host of them  all of these rules are fine too  they are very much like the rules of a religion or the rules of a certain design esthetic they may seem arbitrary nonsensical or completely superfluous to the uninitiated but they all serve functions and nevertheless they exist someone thought of them wrote them down and others like them many people follow these rules  that is also just fine  its when these people insist that everyone else must also follow their flag rules  that is strict rules about the proper handling of special pieces of colored fabric were not talking about organ transplants or unexplored ordinance here just nicely decorated cloth  that they have crossed a line  why dont they see it  your religion says you must do these things and mustnt do those things  by being a member of that religion you are following the rules you set down for yourself  you cant mandate those rules for others  are these flag nuts the same people who want to tell me what i can and cant do with my body   are they the same people who want public libraries and schools to ban certain books they dont like  how can they be such proud devotees of america and completely oblivious to the incompatability of personal freedom and restrictions on expression  some such proud americans living near me have said that people who burn the flag in protest should be thrown in prison for life be physically tortured raped and killed  many agreed  i suggested that seems like harsh treatment for someone who is destroying a piece of cloth that is not stolen property and is identical to hundreds of millions of other pieces of cloth like it  in fact i said it shouldnt be punished at all and is actually a protected form of expression ie free speech  they called me a piece of shit  oh they railed at me  these lunatics crawled out of the woodwork to type in all caps at me because clearly im the idiot and i dont care about that  call me an idiot piece of shit call me a cunt and a whore call me a nazi or terrorist or whatever  its their right to call me whatever because they have the right to free speech  im glad they can call me whatever they want without fear of being arrested for blasphemy or some other medieval bullshit  but seriously who tf are these psychos  did no one else listen in 7th grade social studies  did none of them make the connection between pride and nationalism and between censorship and fascism  im so grossly disappointed in all of us  if you told me when i was that 7th grader long long time ago now that our country was this full of morons i wouldnt have believed you  i think the countrys average iq now has dropped into hypothermic territory and scarier still is i dont have much hope that well ever be able to fix it  i cant see any path for us to move forward with a populace that is this dumbasfuck  its not fun to be an average cow in a herd stampedeing toward a cliff realizing that were all going to plummet to our deaths if we dont change course and screaming at the rest of the cattle to turn but your herd mates are all too fucking stupid to listen

if you have an ethical problem with underpaying people to keep prices down well maybe have that discussion with yourselves

2024-11-29 16:20:36,is the problem that the democratic party isnt democratic enough,"ive been thinking the mission of the democratic party from now on should be to break down the 2party monopoly duopoly i dont know anyway leadership should fight for ranked choice voting at all levels of government 

they should also fight to get rid of the filibuster and the electoral college along with gerrymandering fight that supreme court judges get elected through other means other than a sheer presidential selection i mean  the us is ranked 3036 in the world democracy index and is deemed a deficient democracy   
  
im sure they dont want to bite their own tail but the truth is  you cant be a democratic party in a nondemocratic system i mean 2 freaking parties in a country of 350  million people is a complete joke 

now a true democratic system is going to be harder to implement because the 2party paradigm is well baked into the american psyche but its absolutely necessary maga should have been its own extremefringe movement but because it has to be 2 and only 2 competing parties it has swallowed up the republican party and now the political overton window has stretched out way further and they have so much more power than if maga were just a third party  and we are all paying for it

no one on his legion of doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor

ive been calling this game magates and p2025 have laid out for years but i need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me im not right i hope im not

if you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 republican terms you might feel like this is an actually real scenario if im way off on something please call me out im not saying this will be exact but that the end result will be the same regardless of the hows and whens

we wont have mass deportation like hes saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arms power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time  which eventually through p2025 can fall on anyone they decide they wish to detain or get rid of even us born citizens they will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process

it will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate then find people who are expendable or have criminal records people with addictions or that have had govt assistance down to people that just arent american enough dangers or nonpatriots they will be rounded up to be reformed theyll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side and those suffering doing chinesegulaggestapostyle govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us you can change the terms and methods but lets assume they can do what they want because they have everything they need now to do so

think its crazy conspiracy yeah i get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us but its all in the 2025 playbook and weve been here before this time only the people can stop it but that wont happen when were scared and shut in our homes asking for help saying yeah but not my family right

all they need to do is what ive been saying for years declare another seemingly needed but ultimately bullshit war 

i think this time it will be the war on immigration or something so they can make up emergency war time actslaws just like the war on terror which was how we got the patriot act  remember that civil liberties trampled on privacy violated we were scared so they were allowed to quell our fears but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies but at americans themselves 

people are scared again and just like covid you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution this time i truly feel like theyre going to take everything from us and what i fear more is that they know we cant sustain our population anymore and they intend to close ranks save themselves and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory

2024-11-26 22:32:31,democrats that said they dont vote because they live in an area thats always red and their vote doesnt matter,"about 86 million eligible voters didnt vote in the last election

if youre one of them that didnt vote because you feel like your voice doesnt matter im not here to blame or attack you its easy to feel powerless in a system that often feels stacked against us my point is simple you matter more than you might think even if your candidate doesnt win when you show up others in your community will see theyre not alone maybe your vote could inspire them to show up next time

lets take a closer look at why every vote matters even in areas perceived as overwhelmingly red

 example 1 glascock county georgia

 registered voters 2073
 turnout 81 1682 ballots cast
 didnt vote 391
    trump 1534 9186
    kamala harris 133 796

even if all 391 nonvoters had shown up and voted for kamala giving her 524 votes trump still would have won in counties like these its easy to feel like voting is futile

 example 2 baker county georgia

 registered voters 2066
 turnout 72 1486 ballots cast
 didnt vote 580
    trump 883 5982
    kamala harris 590 3997

if just 444 of the 580 nonvoters had shown up and voted for kamala she would have won its not impossible to imagine enough of those remaining voters choosing kamala to secure the win

even if your candidate doesnt win increasing turnout changes perceptions for example in glascock county 1534 vs 524 sends a stronger message than 1534 vs 133 it shows democrats have local support making progressive voices less isolated this visibility can energize communities spark deeper discussions and even sway centrists or independents in future elections

its not lost on me that counties are part of larger congressional districts where votes across multiple counties determine outcomes for house seats and electoral votes for example theres an entire section of georgia that voted blue in the last election but turned red in this one if just one county in that area turns blue again it could create a ripple effect shifting the districts votes back to blue in future elections

every vote contributes to a bigger pictureits not just about winning today but about shaping tomorrows outcomes

the one thing i want you to take from this you matter

disclaimer this 86 million estimate only includes those who were eligible to vote people unable to vote due to administration barrier roles incarceration felony convictions mental incapacitation homelessness or living in us territories were already subtracted as best as possible from the 262083034 votingage population estimated by the us census bureau in 2023 this is why i say about 86 millionthe real number could be slightly higher or lower i did the best i could",ellieminnow,Liberal,42,150,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1h0ovd0/democrats_that_said_they_dont_vote_because_they/

even when we do win its not like they care anyways i just saw a video about how trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation buying on margin and high variable interest rates and while i care that eggs are still expensive i stopped listening to trumps boasting a long time ago trump supporters are still blaming biden and theyll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can we act like people arent treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though theyll pretend that their crowd has never done that i cant be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out by all means it might make your life better but we act like its only been a good thing for liberals and democrats 

i talk to trump supporters both in my family and workplace they havent fallen besides themselves since matt gaetz withdrew they see it as either an operation to remove democraticrhino opposition to trumps next appointee or as gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the democrat psyop and forged accusations wont distract from trumps next term we know that handing them the receipts wont convince them because they will have forgotten to read when they do happen to get a win we default to talking about our wins that they dont care about and it just comes across as though were living in a fantasy land its like were trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do

but i suppose americans want white supremacists and nazis in control because thats what they voted for in this election morons in swing states were mad the price of eggs were higher than four years ago so they voted with their wallets instead of their brains 

yet somehow democrats keep getting blamed for their rhetoric for acting like they were above everyone else or calling everyone garbage they never did or said any of that trump did though for sure

however the democrats of today is something im familiar with i want to know what it meant to be a democrat say 60 years ago

there were still americans fighting for equal rights theres always charts showing how long women have had to wait to file for divorce own a house have their own bank account really basic shit that could never get taken away today

what were democrats fighting foragainst 60 years ago 

as a tangent i just want to remind everyone how far weve come nixon got 49 states and almost double the amount of votes than mcgovern america was pure red and yes the republican back then was different than today

but gay people can marry who they want its been than way for almost 10 years trans people have more opportunity to be who they are than ever before women unfortunately suffered a huge loss in 2022 and still arent quite there yet in other ways but have much more rights than women did 60 years ago

thats how far weve come trump and his little clique are most likely going to do some shit shit that will undo years of work to equalize america but like ms harris said we are not going back too much as been gained for the 74 million people in america who believe in those rights to allow him to take them away without a fight",RenziumZ,Liberal,12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gw9390/follow_up_what_were_democrats_like_prior_to_roe_v/

2024-11-19 18:04:40,what were republicans like before trump tldr at the bottom,"i was 2 years old when w bush was reelected in 2004 so i never paid much attention to politics obviously hell im sure that even when i was 6 i probably didnt know obama was president for a long while but i knew he was president as some point and obviously hes amazing

but 2016 rolls around and donald trump comes into the picture i was rooting for hilary but ultimately at that point in my life it didnt affect me that much so him winning was not a big deal and tbh i dont even know when i started to get into politics because i voted for biden in 2020 but that year was such a blur that i dont even know how i felt

but i think it must start in 2022 when the supreme court overturned roe v wade i looked into what caused it and found out it was trump and his justice picks thats when it really started i began looking briefly at some of his campaign in 2016 and just seeing the lying pretentious pos he really is 

but i ultimately didnt pay that much attention i figured if biden won once then he could win again but we all know how that turned out

i was so excited to see kamala harris running i truly believed trumps cult was dying out evident by his loss in 2020 that there was no way hed win this election would be a slam dunk and a retribution of the 2016 election so for all 107 days of her campaign as well as every day since ive kept a close eye on the him with each new rally and piece of misinformation further cementing my hatred of him and his dumbass followers

the fucking insult to injury is that he doesnt even fucking campaign he talks about literally nothing for hours and people eat it up in a normal world his campaign wouldve ended so many times need i remind you that this made jacked off a microphone and pretended to suck it fucking hell

ive never gotten to experience it because literally 76 million people voted for him and all of them are usually batshit crazy

because it seems like from an ideological standpoint no republican or democrat should ever get along but the two party system is apparently so integral to the backbone of the country that we just have to push against each other for eternity

the book gained little traction in late1990s britain dismissed as melodramatic and out of touch with the eras optimism but it found a warmer reception in the us particularly among silicon valley libertarians peter thiel cofounder of paypal cited the sovereign individual as one of the most influential books in his life praising its startlingly accurate predictions about cryptocurrency digital identities and even bots as reesmogg and davidson predicted

gta new digital form of money would consist of encrypted sequences  unique anonymous and verifiable  tradable at a keystroke in a multitrilliondollar wholesale market without borders

sound familiar bitcoin arrived a decade later

thiel however doesnt just buy into technolibertarianism hes also wrestled publicly with christianitys role in shaping wokeness in an interview reported by mediaite thiel said



gtchristianity  always takes the side of the victim  maybe you should think of wokeness as ultrachristianity or hyperchristianity its an extreme intensification  the past is terrible and you can never overcome it

thiel seems to see wokeness as a kind of mutated christianityfocused on sin victimhood and moral judgment without forgiveness

this leaves us in a precarious spot christian nationalism with its regressive social agenda is troubling enough but a future shaped by social darwinists like thielwho see safety nets and compassion as obstaclescould be even darker right now both forces seem to be jockeying for influence over weekend at trumpys with the likes of elon musk and thiel cozying up to trump in ways christian nationalists can only dream of

whichever side wins the most influence the rest of us stand to lose

christian nationalism is a plague but if social darwinists take control things will get truly dark imo they want the destruction of any and all social safety nets

the difference is that rightwing christians want the church to provide the safety net not the government the government is perceived as a threat to their power and ability to provide that even if churches only provide a minimal safety net on their terms and are often designed in ways to enhance their authority and can be exploitive

whereas social darwinists literally dont want social safety nets at all they want survival of the fittest",ShaneKaiGlenn,Liberal,31,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1guzzlj/social_darwinist_oligarchs_are_a_bigger_threat/

2024-11-19 00:06:51,ais solution to the 20242028 election,"like most of you i am just about done with maga and the gop and our gullible citizens  i am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying so i went to ai for help  i think its response has some interesting strategies so i am copying it here  sorry if this breaks some sub rule

heres my question so recently donald trump the republican candidate won the 2024 election over kamala harris the democratic candidate  from what i can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them  this allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them  use your logical mathematical mind to determine how kamala harris or a future democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy

the response 
countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured multilayered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology heres a logical breakdown of what kamala harris or a future democratic candidate could do
1 prioritize narrative simplicity and consistency

    the problem an avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember
    the solution
        develop 35 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable eg working for every american
        use repetition to create cognitive stickiness every appearance speech and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes
        frame responses to attacks within this narrative for example thats another distraction were focused on core theme

2 use selective factchecking strategically

    the problem countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the illusory truth effect where repetition makes lies seem true
    the solution
        choose to debunk highimpact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message
        use a truth sandwich approach start with the truth briefly debunk the lie and return to the truth
        collaborate with trusted media and factchecking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods

3 humanize the campaign

    the problem broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding
    the solution
        focus on individual stories and human connections highlight real people and how policies affect them directly
        deploy surrogates trusted community voices not just politicians to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles

4 leverage data and analytics

    the problem lies spread because they are emotionally engaging often through targeted digital campaigns
    the solution
        employ microtargeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts
        monitor misinformation trends using ai and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly

5 strengthen institutional trust

    the problem lies undermine trust in institutions making it easier for false narratives to thrive
    the solution
        position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform avoid defensiveness instead advocate for transparency and accountability
        partner with trusted nonpolitical organizations to communicate key messages

6 call out the flood of lies

    the problem people may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out
    the solution
        introduce the concept of lie overload into public discourse use humor or metaphors eg trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies
        highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims framing them as disrespectful to voters

7 emphasize unity and forwardlooking optimism

    the problem lies can create polarization and fear which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives
    the solution
        offer a vision that is positive inclusive and solutionoriented
        use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation

8 prebunk before debunk

    the problem lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared
    the solution
        anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction
        for example before a false claim about taxes emerges emphasize were ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share

by sticking to these strategies a democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformationheavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness ultimately the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions rather than just reacting to falsehoods",neepster44,Liberal,19,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/

2024-11-16 17:36:09,yes there is a difference between liberal and conservative brains its the amygdala,"dozens of studies have been done on the difference between liberal and conservative brains with mri imaging all over the world  and the word theyve coined for it is neural partisanship multiple research studies show that conservatives have a slightly larger amygdala  the brains emotion and fear processing center the difference is small  but has large impact on how conservatives see the world this slight enlargement makes conservatives more reactive to what they perceive as threats this is not to say there are not other factors life experiences that influence them but neurobiology provides a framework about our predisposition to certain positions

the amygdala is also responsible for gearing flightfight responses under the influence of the cortisol produced by the adrenal glands most of these studies were done by linking participants to mri machines and observing their neural reactions some researchers got so good at interpreting the data that they could tell if a person leaned liberal or conservative just by observing how neural pathways lit up during the session 

the amygdala acts like the brains alarm system for everyone when it detects a threat it springs into action triggering our fightorflight response in the context of anger the amygdala is often the first to sound the alarm setting off a cascade of emotional and physiological responses  change is often perceived as a threat and is a stressor for many people but for conservatives its something to which they are very sensitive their response to a perceived threat will typically be greater than a liberal brain 

cue the media 

conservatives dont typically leave their news bubble  they watch fox oan newmax and others who feed them fearmongering news in a continuous stream which often generates fear and anxiety they dont call it rage media for nothing being fed threats  to themselves their families and their country   247 leads to high cortisol production 247 essentially all this means  is that their brains are marinated in fear anxiety and that they will often respond to threats with anger rather than a reasoned consideration of the issue

on a personal note it is absolutely amazing how triggered conservatives get when you give them this information i was called a moron and bitch by one man who then went on to quote scripture talking about how jesus approved of war i was invited to go outside and have my face punched in   just in the last few daysso   apparently even having a discussion about the source of their political orientation produces a rage reaction in them seriously over the top anger

the following are additional notes from the studies in no particular order  and they explain so much when we look at the predispositions of conservatives and liberals

one interesting study found that compared to liberals conservatives show a larger volume of gray matter in the right amygdala ramg a region that plays a critical role in the processing of negative aversive human emotions like sadness fear and threat and less gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex acc a region linked to error monitoring belief updating and affectregulation

liberals and conservatives differ in their neural interpretations of political concepts

conservatives are worse at distinguishing truths and falsehoods than liberals

conservatives have greater psychological resilience attributable to greater impulse control and causal reasoning

conservatives compared to liberals see scientific and nonscientific viewpoints as closer in legitimacy note in other words if your medical doctors tells you one thing about your medical condition and the guy youre sitting next to in the casino tells you something differentconservatives are more likely to give them both the same weight anyone remember covid

liberals show greater cognitive flexibility than conservatives meaning they have a greater ability to appropriately and efficiently adjust their behavior according to a changing environment

in moral judgments conservatives emphasize value of actions while liberals emphasize value of expected outcome

liberals solve problems more via insight than stepbystep analysis

conservatives give more weight to negative information than positive information compared with liberals

individual political attitudes correlate with physiological traits such as sensitivity to sudden noises and threatening visual images

when faced with a conflict liberals are more likely than conservatives to alter their habitual response when cues indicate it is necessary

liberals focus on the future more than the past while conservatives focus on the past more than the future

conservatives and liberals react similarly to positive incentives but conservatives have greater sensitivity to negative stimuli

reliance on quick efficient and low effort thought processes yields conservative ideologies while effortful and deliberate reasoning yields liberal ideologies

what does this mean for the future

well we need to acknowledge that they dont have a lot of control over their biological fearanxiety responses but they are still responsible for their language and behavior they are riding high right now  but it is incredibly difficult to have a discussion with someone who is kept in a heightened state of fear and rage  and who cant break their addiction to rightwing media 

i wish i had more answers but for now if we can just understand some of their physiological responses and understanding how their brains react  it will be a step in the right direction stop trying to reason argue discuss point out harm economic disaster etc they dont even hear it they just perceive those as liberal threats become angry and you will have accomplished nothing except raising your own blood pressure

but musk a man who thrives on reinvention channeled his humiliation into calculated revengenot just against those who mocked him but against the entire system he saw as flawed and hypocritical if the acquisition of twitter had turned him into a global punchline he would reshape the punchline into a weapon

over time the platform transformed under his guidancechaotic polarizing and riddled with policy decisions that seemed less about business strategy and more about dismantling cultural norms musks motivations became inscrutable but one pattern emerged he sought to amplify voices that promised upheaval regardless of their political orientation he reconnected with figures like donald trump whose populist appeal and chaotic energy mirrored musks own ethos of disruption

it wasnt ideological musk didnt care about partisan divides he cared about breaking the status quo america had humiliated him and now he would humiliate america in funding trumps political resurgence musk wasnt endorsing a candidatehe was creating a spectacle his millions flowed into the campaign not to champion a cause but to watch the worlds most powerful democracy devour itself

kamala harris wasnt defeated by donald trump she was outmaneuvered by elon musks shadowy influence musks resources his platform and his vendetta shaped the electoral landscape the election wasnt just a contest of ideologies it was a stage for musks experiment in chaos

2024-11-14 15:52:23,we need to actually create blue maga,"im being dead fucking serious perhaps it was my navet but if you had asked me last monday i didnt think we would be here i gave the american people way too much credit but were here and the horrors have already started at an alarming rate

i am posting this from the perspective of someone who grew up republican and was a republican staffer on the hill ive spent time in these spaces long story short it was a long conversion process but i went from an old school romneymccain type to someone who is comfortably just as leftist as aoc however that journey has brought me to a place where im increasingly infuriated that the dems dont seem to fully understand their enemy nor have they demonstrated the grit needed in a moment like this

i truly believe we are at a critical moment where the coming months could decide our fate for the rest of our lives that fat orange fuck has vowed to reshape our country into something none of us would recognize and yet kamala conceded with barely a peep despite some actual concerning anomalies imo biden is teeheeing with tangerine hitler in the oval office warren is tweeting about how ol donny boy broke the law again hes a felon thats what criminals do hello and no one seems to be calling for the type of drastic action or leadership that is needed right now the republicans are stabbing us to death and the dems are handwringing about whether its ethical to punch back because we dont want to be like them

which brings me to this if we are to survive if our home is to survive we need to somehow find the means to start fighting dirty and im dead fucking serious when i say we actually need a blue maga movement a blue tea party movement activists and candidates who are populist loud and willing to throw every fucking dirty trick the republicans have done over the last decade right back in their faces 

im talking candidates who insult their opponents and attack establishment dems on a level not yet seen before activists who go to elected official offices with the pure intent of creating click bait content to feed our base podcasters who make that little shitler nick fuentes and that bald idiot rogan look tame a multi prong ruthless approach with the end goal of making the dems cower like the maga fuckers cucked the republicans and none of this fucking infighting everyone falls in line everyone supports the movement if you dont youre fair game too

2024-11-11 17:25:43,what i think needs changing,"some quick thoughts on what i think needs changing

 dems need to focus on concrete solutions and abandon all of the feelings and vibes nonsense  i could hear it in almost every speech the last 4 years  dripping with feelings and warm fuzzies just stop  propose longterm solutions or dont even try  the vast majority of americans want problem solving not an emotional bath  a b and c are problems and we think x y and z will address at least some of it and heres how and heres how it gets paid for
 deal with the border  i used to think the greatest unforced political error in history was romneys my message is for you not the 47 of americans that dont pay taxes  not anymore  escorting millions of border crossers into red border states  who then bussed them to blue cities and suburbs   is now the greatest unforced political error that the free world will ever see
 stop marching dudes with mustaches red lipstick and dresses in front of voters i believe most folks dont care what the individual does with their own time but for the love of god dont alienate voters like you did  that was another unforced political error
 never again make the mistake of pigeonholing the other candidate as a nazi or a felon without proving to voters beyond a shadow of a doubt that your vision of governance taxation foreign policy economic growth measures etc is better than theirs
 never again run for president and tell voters that you want to raise taxes  even if its only on high earners  high earners have kids parents siblings friends and neighbors who all vote also  if a reporter ever asks a future dem candidate about their position on taxes the answer should be we feel strongly that we need to get the nose of the national debt pointed back into a safer trajectory we have a list of investments in infrastructure that need to be addressed but nothing  no bridges no roads no dams no power lines  is going to be replaced if republicans keep eroding the tax base and driving us ever deeper in debt were on a bad trajectory and both sides got us there

on this level over american politics globally until he was a candidate people played dirty but they didnt play this dirty things that have happened over his candidacy if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an american president i would say no anyone who is old enough sane enough smart enough would agree like dude bush was cooler than this republicans were different then had more integrity now as for him helping the economy bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems to fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs people who are educated people who are secure have homes access to information and resources this creates job growth personal growth and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens businesses with government regulation have limits on what they can charge because businesses unregulated can charge whatever claim whatever and get off scot free with minimal consequence whats that mean say you

they immediately proclaimed that they were sure all along that harris would lose they blamed everyone including the voters thats what pissed me off the most they had the balls to blame those that voted talk about total gaslighting meanwhile the right wing media gloats mocks the liberals and talks about liberal tears  theyre smug and theyre all assholes

im not buying it as i look at trump numbers again i see 74 million votes thats what he had last time back in 2020 his base has not changed going on joe rogan didnt change which by the way just want to say i called out joe rogan for being a conservative shill a long time ago 

but i digress where are these extra votes going to come from harris still sits firmly 4 million votes behind trump eat me no way she catches up those 15 million other votes just stayed home 

and i agree with the fact that they stayed home because she was a woman had she been a man shed have won this election

misogyny is ingrained in america that is why she lost its not because she wasnt qualified or what have you its because shes a woman

she was younger smarter quicker and agile yet she lost to a senile old man who takes a crap anytime someone says something bad about him

you will never convince me it wasnt because she was a woman

i say that as a white atheist bi man living in idaho by the way so if you want to question my motives for saying this go for it

edit i see there are comments here pointing out the racism and yes i agree america is racist as shit but obama got elected he was a man harris got more votes than clinton but still couldnt clinch it this tells me that america is more misogynistic than it is racist but it is absolutely racist im not disputing that",ComfortableWage,Liberal,367,333,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gnrlns/i_keep_hearing_theories_about_how_15m_people/

2024-11-09 21:17:51,liberals need to stop blaming themselves and stop blaming trump voters,"theres only one culprit behind why this season turned out the way it did and it is misinformation a concentrated wellfunded scorchedearth campaign of lies that has been carried out from the ground up by republican leadership

it starts with fox news built up over decades to be a machine that spews out hatefilled lies 247 into the ears of the public it continues with the media ecosystem of small publications podcasters and media personalities that echo the fox news talking points and take it even further waging the front lines of the culture war out of personal passion not realizingor not caringtheyre the acting as the gullible patsies of the oligarchs who fund it all and it is capped in these years by trump himself the most shameless liar to ever sully the stage of american politics with his presence trump who cannot open his mouth without lying who has managed to break every record for the number of lies spoken in a single speech who built his popularity on the back of one big lie after anotherwithout hesitating either to intersperse them with a thousand small lies

it is tempting of course to look at our own leaders and our own policies and try to ask what did we do wrong what policy could we present differently to appeal to insert demographic here but this is misguided because how would any policy hold any appeal if they never know what it is

its tempting to look at the facts and the way our leaders spoke about them and say she should have hit this fact harder driven home this point more clearly but what purpose does that ever serve if they dont know what the facts are

similarly it is tempting to take refuge in the miseryladen moan of oh this country is more racistsbigotedmisogynist than i thought it was certainly trump actively courts the racist and misogynist vote but if that were the beginning and end of the story then why did so many minorities and women vote for him when you ask the rankandfile votersnot the hardcore bigotswhy they voted the way they did it has to do with economy policy the border and their own wellfare all hardandfast realworld factors

factors they are wrong about because of a deliberate campaign of lies

well never be able to move toward a sane government as long as lies reign unchecked across our society how can you make good decisions if you dont know the truth and trump supporters dont need to be unusually ignorant or naive to believe the lies when theyre coming from every direction when you hear the same thing on your preferred big cable tv news program and from your favorite podcaster and from your candidate for president all people who you should be able to trust youd have to be crazy to question it

my theory is a cabal of wealthy oligarchs funded and built this media environment in order to promote policies good for themselveslow taxes on the rich and low regulation on business in so doing they have betrayed the trust of the millions of people who look to media for trustworthy information

and we are never going to move forward as a country liberal or otherwise unless we can undermine this campaign of lies and somehow move back to a shared sense of factsand ones that are actually based in fact

so stop blaming bigotry or harris or trump voters blame the oligarchs whove built this engine of lies for their own benefit

2024-11-09 20:15:42,how to fight and actually win,"first ask yourself what is a fucking liberal 

if you let them define it then youre going to lose immediately words must mean something and theirs mean nothing 

a liberal is someone who wants change against what has been yes there are other definitions but we are gonna be merriamwebster about this 

now the idea that republicans cant be liberal isnt true lincoln was a liberal republican thats important as the demonization of republicans will most certainly lead into not prying away their base and prying away is just as important as creating a new movement and trying to get people to follow 

but we dont need to create a new movement there already exist one that is quite liberal we borrow it but we dont return it 



the current state of the world is that the very wealthy literally own everything even republicans acknowledge this but they cant put their finger on it talking about voters not the elites who im speaking of anyways doesnt matter what country you go to either left or right they own it 

even progressive voices acknowledge this but they  put their focus on more than one topic and then the message becomes lost 


why is that important 

republicans tend to be single issue voters dems tend to focus on multiple things but then will hardline towards single issues at the end so the single issue that has overlap is classism 

and the solution to classism most certainly covers almost all topics and demographics they have you dont 



the pivot must stress classism you dont always have to detail it so eloquently as if you were a philosopher being quoted some hundreds of years from now i wouldnt do that as youll lose focus of the uneducated 

conservative absolutely protect that classist ideology but dont attack conservatives themselves just the belief in their billionaires 



next we must sooner rather than later pick someone to lead this the way we do that is by highlighting them and sharing them everywhere obviously we all must brainstorm who that is but it cannot be sanders because of age ideally its someone middle aged that gets young and old on board 60 is not middle aged somewhere around 40 is 

this person must not be elite or come from elites it must be grassroots you cannot have them accept from the rich they must abstain they essentially cannot be worth millions 

 

if you did not read and only scrolled towards the end the problem is that liberals who want to change things arent focusing on the main issue of the fact that the elites of owned things since our countrys birth that needs to change and we must pivot to stress it 

progressives need to understand that a lot of the issues involving civil liberties can change due to solving this issue and conservatives dont actually make up much of the country the parties do most people believe in change 

economic issues play one of the largest if not the largest historically and most likely always will 



edit but also brainstorm dont just take it from me but do understand that classism is going to play the biggest role",EducationMental648,Liberal,26,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gnivma/how_to_fight_and_actually_win/

2024-11-08 18:27:08,temporary abortion compromise followed immediately by massive electoral reform,"i suggest we should look at this election loss from a perspective of votesplitting its not the only valid perspective but there are lessons here

we can approximate the country into four quadrants divided along two axes prolifeprochoice prodemocracyantidemocracy the prochoiceprodemocracy party is the institutional democratic party the prolifeprodemocracy people explicitly arent allowed in that club because the party refuses to as they would put it compromise on womens rights and the prolife crowd wont compromise on the issue either the antidemocracy people are the institutional republican party and were able to work together better regardless of their prolifeprochoice stance so now we have effectively three parties in a system built for two and votesplitting screws the entire prodemocracy camp

the correct solution is for the democratic party to compromise on the prolifeprochoice axis on an explicitly temporary basis allow prolife candidates back into the party on the condition that once the democratic party gains power in any state or at a federal level it should immediately begin a defined program of massive systematic reform which includes reforms that make the system function with more than two parties no more firstpastthepost approval voting ftw among other solutions after that the prolife and prochoice wings can safely part ways but still opportunistically cooperate without handing the entire government over to the fascists

the gop became the party of trump due to votesplitting he won the 2016 primary with only 40 of the votes cast the gop didnt fix the problem they doubled down can the democrats instead learn the lesson that the fundamental problem is our election systems and until that gets fixed nothing else will",swcollings,Liberal,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gmpeef/temporary_abortion_compromise_followed/

whats the best thing people can do now to maximise the chances of a good future in a world with a potentially unstable us

a great one ive seen is people boycotting republican supporting companies

this next one is just an example and is probably really stupid so please provide some better ideas  
obviously more sensible nations might have concerns about a second trump presidency and might be keen to get immigrants from america organisations can be formed to help people emigrate  heck being trapped in an unstable country is a crisis worthy of the formation of a charitable organisation at this point people can drive investment in more sensible nations so they stand a better chance of competing economicallytechnologically with a potentially unstable us in the future

i am a taiwaneseamerican dual citizen who could not care less about which western politician digs their own countrys grave i only take interest when taiwan and south korea are at risk of being buried in said grave i did not vote for trump and i did not vote for harris therefore i did not vote against lgbtq and womens interests nor did i vote against gun owners and constitutionalists interests i will not tell anyone if i voted third party or if i just left the presidential candidate slot blank the only thing left to do is work with what we got that if we intelligently advocate and carefully act we can still convince the administration to change some of their decisions for the better

and after the predicted response stating that trumps administration is intent on implementing fascist policy i ask the question if there is an actual imminent threat of fascism are you going to become the modern day french resistance will you take up arms or at least support the insurgencys war effort

i asked that question on my instagram story i put it as a caption overlaid on the french resistance drive by scene from the great escape movie and on the next slides included squad gameplay and ukrainian infantry machine gunner footage to emphasize what real world warfare could be like

i see a lot of talk about fascism and project 2025 throughout our leftleaning public spheres however what i dont see is anyone talking about the fact that fascism by definition is distinguished from other forms of totalitarian governments by its glorification and use of political violence

if you truly think that we are witnessing the emergence of american facism you see political violence as not merely a possiblity but a certainty im not attempting to make a claim here for or against fascism being on the horizon just that is what saying that it is would imply

this is not a call to violence this is simply highlighting the fact that our constitution has provisions to prevent our country from ever regressing to totalitarian governing of which fascism is the most insidious i hope this doesnt get censored and i hope this can shift some minds to understanding why conservatives have for so long refused to sacrifice any ground when it comes to gun rights those rights belong to you too and i hope you dont squander them thinking itll never be necessary",Jet_Maal,Liberal,15,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gm64q1/what_separates_totalitarian_nationalism_from/

2024-11-07 20:13:57,my rant about the reddit bubble and things,"change we can believe in

like many are im frustrated by the election but at this point im also frustrated by the reactions on many subs both before and after the election

 polls
i spent a lot of time on the main politics sub a lot of my reddit activity was on that sub i had been posting that the polls were showing a close race as far back as the beginning of this year and i reiterated that point up until election day and every time people would respond with various excuses why the polls would be ignored and the excuses followed an extremely predictable progression its too early for the polls to be accurate gt biden hasnt started campaigning yet gt harris just started campaigning gt the polls arent accurate gt the polls are being flooded with bad data the nyt came out with that one poll that people said was terrible and should be completely ignored because it oversampled conservative voters which completely missed the point of what the poll was trying to accomplish

 election day
as soon as the florida results came in and showed an unexpected hard shift to the right i felt things looked bad i commented that it could be a bad portent of what was to come people were completely ignoring massive shifts in results like miamidade but people scoffed and literally said i was dooming on the nyt map even before the swing states really started reporting in larger numbers you could see the mass of red arrows indicating shifts to the right across the board but nope doesnt mean much because the swing states could still be different people kept repeating that it was just like the 2020 red mirage but completely ignored how the red mirage in that election happened in the first place and why it wasnt happening again this election

 voters
people frequently posted questions and are still doing it about how do people still vote for trump i think this is probably one of the major points that people just do not seem to get yes trump has a relatively small core of hardcore supporters they know what he says what his policies are and will do and embrace it all because they want exactly that but the vast majority of people vote for him because they have no exposure to politics they dont know what trump says his policies his actions etc and its very difficult to get through to those people how do you break through to people who ignore politics its a catch22 situation because of this they do not understand the rhetoric of him being an authoritarian or why his policies will be harmful

and this is where the lefts particularly on reddit messaging completely breaks down and becomes harmful because these people dont understand the reasons calling them fascists or bigots has no context they are being labeled as something for reasons that are completely unknown to them it gives them no incentive to vote for your candidate or vote at all when they see one side attacking them or what is viewed as attacking

what they do know is that trump has told them he will bring about a change that will improve the aspects of their lives that are important to them the policies are irrelevant the actions are irrelevant they want change

which brings me back to the first line

 change we can believe in

this was the campaign slogan for obama in 2008 its a brilliant slogan because its exactly what point want change the specifics dont matter change means different things for different people and people want change that will improve their lives trumps campaign pushed change he told people what they wanted to hear and they rewarded him for it

and its also why harris slogan was a fucking disaster were not going back this is exactly what people want though they want to go back to before inflation and before things cost so much they want to go back to when people didnt call them fascists it doesnt matter the reasons for those things happening now what matters is what the people want sure she tried to address those things by pointing out what biden has passed that helped the economy and protections for various civil rights but its a horrible campaign strategy people do not view the economy and their own personal expenses as the same thing ask people how the chips act or how the bbb act has improved their lives you wont get an answer so telling them that those things did is useless and harris ever saying that shell continue bidens work or do the same things was incredibly stupid you dont tell people who are demanding change whatever that change may be that youre not going to change of course they wont vote for you then

reddit is not reality neither is twitterx facebook or any other social media no doubt theyre all bubbles in their own right but if liberals really want to encourage voters to support them they need to stop labeling people regardless of whether its right or wrong or true or not it simply does not work the last 3 elections are proof of that

redditors need to break out of the bubble that exists here polling for the past 10 months gave indication that democrats were going to have trouble and yet were shocked when thats exactly what happened ignoring that did not change reality ignoring that people were frustrated with the state of things did not change reality people were going to vote for trump because of it and simply labeling them with negative titles to try and guilt them to vote for harris accomplished nothing

part of the problem is where people interact with others too on reddit its a lot of polar opposites hard left with hard right so of course it gets a bit contentious but out in the real world its different if you want average joe to see your side acknowledge that shit can suck right now both you and him probably wish groceries were cheaper your ideas on how to fix it likely differ but you have to start somewhere and just discarding him and calling him a fascist for supporting the guy who claims that hell improve joes life sure isnt going to make joe want to do anything you suggest to him

fixing the problems i know goes well beyond just getting out of the bubble but its a start to understanding that simply moving forward with the same mentality isnt going to suddenly work",SwimmingThroughHoney,Liberal,15,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1glzwb6/my_rant_about_the_reddit_bubble_and_things/
2024-11-07 18:37:27,another rant  stop externalizing blame,"after the 2016 election i was like most liberals at a complete loss as to what happened and felt like i lacked any understanding of the american electorate i was incredibly disappointed in my fellow americans i still am but weve had eight years to figure them out how to persuade them to vote this infantile sociopath out of public life we failed miserably at doing the things that are under control to win im so sick of hearing about the things that are not under our control like inflation the economy the right wing media and the intelligenceignorancegullibility of the electorate for the love of god can we focus on  addressing the concerns of the american electorate as they are not as we want them to be instead of constantly trying to deflect or explain them away even worse is chastising people for having concerns there are always going to be external factors that influence elections tough sht 

the american electorate is economically populist and socially moderate for the social progressives here you dont have to like it but you do have to accept reality we need a simple and positive message that matches the will of the american electorate 

examples

1 immigration 

we love legal immigration its been the backbone of our country forever we want a fair system where people can legally emigrate however we will not tolerate lawlessness and will strictly enforce our borders i wish we would have addressed this earlier but we are serious now and by the way we have a great bill that republicans failed to pass 

2 inflation 

yes i know the american people are hurting the problem is wages have not kept up with inflation insert populist message

no its not a big deal its slowed down to normal now  

3 social issues 

yes yeah some of us got a little out of hand during the pandemic era but the democratic party categorically rejects the lawlessness of the defund the police movement and rejects government overreach in imposing social values on others we reject identity politics and are here for everyone

no uhh next question 

4 mediasocial media 

yes we categorically reject government censorship of social media outside of state secrets and other serious stuff like that we are not your big brother we believe in freedom yes ill absolutely go on joe rogan and even light up a joint 

no another gop talking point  i cant believe you idiots are falling for it rogan sounds risky

5 freedom 

we are the party of freedom lets legalize weed also online gambling we will protect your porn and obviously a womans right to choose the gop will do none of this they want to be your big brother not us 

6 trump 

yes he doesnt give a shit about you he cares about golfing and doesnt even like to read 

no hes a fascistracist 

the bottom line is we have to address issues as they are brought up  even if they are brought up in bad faith by the gop deflecting and pointing out they are being brought up to manipulate and dont really matter to many peoples lives  even if true  is an absolutely awful strategy that has played a large role in leading to this disaster we are not being manipulated into responding to culture war and other issues we are being manipulated into not responding and taking an actual stance on these issues because the gop knows it looks bad when we do it its not that hard folks if something seems to matter to people address it head on with an economically populist and socially moderate standpoint do not deflect and externalize blame end rant

for many conservative voters the gop is like that wellknown road theyve driven a hundred times even if theres construction potholes or signs saying danger the familiarity of the path makes it feel safer than the new route theyre not stopping to read all the signs because the emotional brain just wants to stick with what feels like home

so when youre seeing people make these choices its less about intelligence and more about which driver in the brain is steering the car",SpiritualCopy4288,Liberal,16,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gle4hi/a_quick_lesson_on_trumps_appeal/

 severely weakened the global fight against climate change thought helene was bad youve doomed your fellow americans to increasing frequency and severity of hurricanes floods wild fires and other extreme weather the same goes for vulnerable countries and regions across the world this will get worse every year until large swathes of the us and the world will become inhabitable

 betrayed your daughters wives and mothers as the gop will strip away womens rights step by step same goes for any other minority in the us

 very likely started a global economic war if trump goes ahead with his plans to put tariffs on everything this will exacerbate a global economic war it will increase inflation likely increase interest rates globally increase unemployment you probably didnt know but the great depression was caused by economic isolationism and tariffs

 killed or critically wounded nato no european ally will trust the us from this point were on our own and so are you

 possibly doomed ukraine to become a russian vassal state you probably dont care because you do not possess the acumen to understand how this undermines europe which used to be your main allies friends and trade partners

 doomed palestinians to an even worse genocide the tragedy of this choice by third party candidate voters is bottomless

 significantly exacerbated the decline and potential death of us democracy

you did this because you are uninformedmisinformed extremely cynical or just dumb there is no excuse for what you have done every man and woman has a responsibility to learn and understand in order to employ your vote in the best possible way for your fellow human beings and nature you failed that horribly

this is such a sad sad day i feel so bad for those that voted blue and for those that will suffer going forward but this will badly affect the entire world not only the us and what youve done cannot be forgiven

first weve already moved the needle in so many ways no matter what happens tonight weve seen progress over the last few years that didnt just happen by chance it happened because people fought for it showed up and stayed engaged change is slow frustratingly so sometimes but every cycle were part of it voting is one stepwhat were building goes beyond today

second dont underestimate the power of a long game the path to lasting change has always been two steps forward one step back look at historymost of the progress weve made came from people who kept showing up even after tough losses our voices arent going anywhere after tonight if we want a future that reflects our values our support for progressive causes candidates and policies will continue regardless of the outcome

finally remember that were in this together the most meaningful changes come from people like us working at every levelin our communities local elections and yes even in the halls of congress its not about one candidate or one election its about building a movement that stays strong beyond election cycles

so lets hang in there today support each other and keep showing up for the values we believe in whatever happens tonight well regroup well keep fighting and well keep moving forward",SpiritualCopy4288,Liberal,9,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gkgkby/election_day_2024_a_few_thoughts_to_keep_us/

how often do we hear people talk about choosing the lesser evil its a phrase that weighs heavily on all of us making it feel like were stuck between two unappealing options i get itits frustrating and disheartening to feel like youre settling for someone who doesnt fully represent your values but i want to share a different perspective with you instead of looking at it as picking the lesser of two evils think of it as voting for the person who can help us get closer to where we want to be

this has completely changed the way i vote and the way i feel about voting  this little change in my thought process has helped me realize that there is no quick way to the finish line  we arent going to travel miles into progress over night  the fight for freedom and equality is a game of inches another way to think about it is climbing up a ladder is a lot slower than falling off a ladder

i fully believe the phrase voting for the lesser evil is a term coined by bad actors the number of times its been pushed on us through social media is not by accident  its designed to make you feel regret and resignation  you dont have to feel this way casting your vote for the candidate that keeps you closer to your goals is a noble thing and you should be proud of it often times you will find when you vote this way your goals come into view faster than you expect

when i think about my vote in this way i get a sense of empowerment im not just a passive participant in a flawed system im part of a movement it encourages me not just to vote but to get involved in my community to advocate for the policies i believe in and to engage in conversations that matter my vote is just one piece of a larger puzzle and i want to help fit those pieces together

so the next time youre preparing to vote or if you havent yet voted in this election remember this youre not just choosing the lesser evil youre making a choice that brings you closer to the future you want to see",Best-Subject-7253,Liberal,14,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gg6949/vote_for_whoever_gets_you_closer_to_your_end_goal/

2024-10-29 13:59:54,learn from my mistakes  dont lose your ability to vote,"edit thank you to everyone who commented with helpful resources i contacted the league of women voters who helped me discover that i am actually eligible for a limited ballot i cast my vote this morning 

several months ago my relationship came to an abrupt end due to domestic violence

i had to move 250 miles away from the city i called home for 12 years back in with my parents i have been making an effort to spend quality time with my aging and sickly mother while im here in spite of how unhappy i am with the environment and circumstances that led me here i took her out for lunch and i was instantly rewarded by being pulled over on the way there rather than issuing me a warning given that i was in an area that im unfamiliar with had not yet seen a speed limit sign on the road id just turned on was mirroring the speed of others around me and in spite of the fact that people constantly drive recklessly at 90 mph on the freeway i had just exited i was issued a speeding ticket and a stern warning that im legally required to update my id address within 30 days of moving

i had specifically held off on updating my address because i do not know how long i will be staying with my parents before finding a new place to live and because i was worried that due to how close to the election we are it would interfere with my ability to vote after the ticket i felt pressured to update my address in case of legal consequences if i happened to be pulled over again cops around here dont seem to do much other than treat citizens like piggy banks so i caved and followed orders i requested that my voter registration be updated at the same time thinking that i was dotting my is and crossing my ts

i showed up to the local polling station yesterday completed practice ballot inhand and was told that im not eligible to vote in this election im not eligible in my prior county of residence im not eligible for statewide office votes that dont have anything to do with my county of residence im not eligible to vote for the fucking president nothing

i updated my address one day after the apparent deadline to be eligible to vote in this election ive been registered to vote for over 10 years in a different county in the same state ive lived in my entire life and ive never had an issue previously so i was not as vigilant as i should have been 

im angry at my ex for causing me to have to move im angry at the cop for being a fucking cop im angry at my states voter registration requirements im angry at myself for not reviewing the rules more closely im just angry and theres nothing i can do except be better in the future

tldr please learn from my mistakes either update your address well in advance or risk it for the biscuit and leave it out of date long enough to submit your ballot

and yet it gets in there still 

having an untrained special employee with incontinence would conceivably increase the risk factor for the spread of this bacteria 

a properly fitting adult diaper and regular and thorough cleaning would minimize that risk 

no one with this condition should be subject to prejudice 

incontinence by its very definition means that the person cant help it 

a sloppy employee who doesnt wash their hands even if they dont suffer from incontinence can spread this disease 

thats why we see all those signs in every restaurant bathroom 

it is really almost all about handwashing maybe someone who doesnt believe in the theory of germs like someone who would refuse to wear a mask even while visiting the sick ward of a hospital during a pandemic its the same sort of person that would refuse to wash their hands after scratching inside their dirty diaper

i say this because if you are a us citizen living overseas and you do not have your ballot yet try again make sure to remind them that it is the law that you can vote from overseas dont let a clerical error hold you back i almost gave up because i thought i was just being disenfranchised but im so glad i tried again

eta i went back and forth with the election official and discovered the actual problem she had sent the email to herself and included every overseas voter in a bcc this meant that my spam fliter must have blocked the email im sure this happened to a huge portion of the other voters so i will insist that the situation be rectified the only way to ensure that peoples spam filter doesnt block the email is if it is not a mass mailing done improperly

is it reasonable to make the proposition that limited illiberalism is necessary to protect liberalism should we impose laws and mandates on misinformation in the news and from online personalities to curb it is it reasonable to mandate that highviewer personalities be required to publicly disclosed sources of financing to show everyone who the primary funders of certain information points are should we limit peoples ability to espouse rhetoric of fascism specifically nazis and supremacists 

personally i lean more towards yes that these limited expansions of power and illiberalism are crucial to curbing the rise of authoritarianism in the west and protecting liberalism in all other domains i have no faith in the people or market in correcting these things it ironically has just made it worse people want fears validated people want emotions represented lies and misinformation does this and it pays well the market encourages this rise sure there are other sources pushing honesty truth and liberalism but it hasnt been enough 

what are we willing to give up to ensure the prosperity of freedom

2024-09-20 16:19:34,democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results  impact too much democrats are also unwilling to highlight geographic wins,"i will preface this by saying that i realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion i am also just explaining my experience im a liberal democrat living in a swing state in the great lakes region my friends family and coworkers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds one interesting thing that ive noticed is that a lot of liberal democrats have what i feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to trump and the republican party now a days ill admit that i had these same beliefs for a long time but in talking to especially more apolitical  moderate independents it just doesnt seem to be holding up

online it seems like a lot of liberal democrats think that its just obvious that democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10 income wise and pretty much better on every other quality of life issue and therefore assume that any white apolitical  independent  really anyone attracted to trump and republicans must be attracted to trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration race lgbtq etc

i think this is a huge disconnect between what democrats think attract swing voters to trump and what actually does pretty much all of the radio tv and print commercials im hearing  reading for trump focus on the economy 

another big thing is this idea that democrats ruin the quality of life in a place there seems to be a disconnect where republicans talk about impact often in an anecdotal way  perceived quality of life and democrats talk about policies  ideals and sometimes data that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact this leads to the whole geographic thing i cant tell you how many times ive heard something like kamala harris is a californian liberal liberals took states like california new york illinois michigan pennsylvania i just saw a comment about liberals destroying connecticut etc and have ruined them red states like texas georgia north carolina south carolina florida kansas tennessee etc are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people policies and politics democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue or highlight blue cities in them or say that the failing states are actually more conservative than people think or they might trot out a list of data showing blue states doing objectively better than red states but republicans are quick to say that basically all red states that have negative data have negative data because of the federal government and the civil war at least where i live there is a pretty common belief that trends across political beliefs that the liberal states i mentioned are way worse than the red states i mentioned and that this due to the people politics and policies of those places and that naturallyhistorically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse also that while republicans may control liberal states mentioned and democrats red states i mentioned this doesnt overcome the idea that the liberal states are liberal and their destruction rests at the hands of the democrats and the red states are conservative and their success rests at the hands of republicans 

 i have come across numerous people who say they dislike trump and a lot of the republicans messaging but that republicans just govern better i get that different personalities are attracted to different parties and that its more natural for republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for democrats i also get that again probably due to the types of people the democratic party attracts democrats tend to focus on data and policies ideology i just wish that democrats would start focusing how how republicans have ruined the quality of life for average americans in places that are both actually controlled by republican politicians and are considered red for the average american because republicans are sure doing that in reverse and its resonating a lot with swing voters",jaker9319,Liberal,32,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1flfz7z/democrats_emphasize_policy_and_ideals_vs_results/

however the conventional wisdom is that trump should have focused on policy during the debate because the weirder comments only appeal to his base and do nothing to persuade undecided voters kamala baited him specifically so he would focus on this nonsense instead of policy so if thats the case why continue to push a losing narrative

personally i think its absurd unfortunately there appears to be a few liberal identifying types who are taking it to heart i dont know where these ideas are coming from other than from republican trolls but i feel that it is completely unnecessary

wanting tthe freedoms enshrined in the us constitution to apply equally to all americans is not a matter of tolerance it is a matter belief in the ideals of the constitution

there is no paradox of tolerance because there is nothing to tolerate you simply respect the freedoms of others thats it if they misbehave you dont have to tolerate that misbehavior or come up with some wacky paradox of tolerance to explain it it is completely unnecessary

so can we all let this tolerance stuff die now i just want to get back to expressing my vicious intolerance of bigotry again

edit

thanks to the kind words and patience of ubgc931216 and uraistlin65  i think i have resolved this issue for myself at least

we can choose what we will and will not tolerate tolerating one thing doesnt require tolerating all things selective tolerance is valid so we can selectively tolerate the things in which our iliberal ideology protects while employing zero tolerance for the behaviors it does not protect

2024-08-23 15:16:33,how i phone banked for kamala and how you can too,"tldr phone banking can be fun and effective give it a try

this is a write up of  my second phone bank  you can read a bout the first here 

finding a phone bank go to  and find a phone bank and time that works for you sign up and youll get a zoom link to join when the session starts

training my call and i believe every call starts with a training session on how to use the dialer software and how to preview the suggested script for that calling session  this session was calling voters in pa so the callers let us know ahead of time that some folks might be trump supporters in case anyone got gruff with us  we were advised to always be polite and not argue

calling they used a website called scale to win for the calls i dialed directly from my browser using the site id recommend using a laptopdesktop for this but a tablet should work as well  i used my laptop and headphones and it worked great  

callers didnt see my name or my phone number a tone would signal that a new caller had picked up and id start the script pressing items for responses such as if id gotten the right person the software had the first name of who i was calling if they were supporting kamala harris or not etc

the end goal for this calling session was to see how folks were voting and to encourage kamala supporters to volunteer  potential volunteers would receive a followup call  i actually had a few who wanted to volunteer and others who said that worklife didnt give them time although they were voting for harris

there were a lot of hang ups and voice mails but the only angry person was actually a kamala voter who was just sick of getting so many calls  i feel for folks that live in swing states

about 10 minutes before the session ended we joined back on our zoom call for a debrief  we also had a short form to fill out about what was frontofmind for voters it was inflation on my calls some folks had questions and suggestions but mostly it was positive feedback

if that were it it would be funny but no because of this investigation voter registration booths are no longer allowed at texas dps so kinda seems like paxton wants to prevent people who initially declined to register to vote not noncitizens who cant vote anyways seeing as how his 2 year undercover operation didnt turn up actual evidence of noncitizens trying to vote but theyre kicking out all voter registration groups",Icy_Statement_2410,Liberal,4,13,https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-launches-investigation-reports-organizations-may-be-illegally

they have been since 2020  

i dont trust the supreme court cant biden just remove them with his power if that happens cant biden refuse to leave or what if he stepped down and let harris be president so she can use her supreme court given authority to stop it

the sc did it with bush v gore but gore willingly stepped down i pray harris doesnt make the same mistake i know we want to be the party of order but at the same time we cant let them cheat

2024-08-02 20:53:39,what kind of prosecutor was kamala harris setting the facts straight,"ive seen in a lot of comments and heard from some friends in real life as well opinions that are very negative about kamalas experience as a district attorney and then attorney general basically anyone claiming kamala was a cop

looking into this i did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things i found first i think its important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job one that deals with tough moral situations especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair i doubt theres a prosecutor in the country who i agree with as a liberal on every decision but despite this prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system and it is really simply incorrect to claim that kamala was just a cop or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record

  
1 harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution while da of san francisco her offices policy was to not seek jail time for mere possession only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure most probably for extenuated issues 

of course since then the bidenharris administration reclassified marijuana and shes the first mainstream presidential candidate to be prolegalization

2 one of harris biggest initatives as da was back on track which provided housing job training and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession the program was really successful greatly reducing the rate of reoffenses and saved tax payers money in the end it was so successful that other cities around the country like baltimore and philly copied it as well

3 shes always been consistently against the death penalty as written in 2004 when she was elected to sf da harris has pledged to continue hallinans practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting threestrike offenders only for serious or violent felonies 

it takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe harris said

4 as ag she created a new division and initiative to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes she also refused to enforce prop 8 the ban on gay marriage on california eventually declared unconstitutional 

for more see public defender i worked with kamala harris she was the most progressive da in california

now who did harris really prosecute hard large corporations polluters and banks

5 she fought for big banks to pay 20 billlion to california home owners during the 20082009 financial crisis and won

6 she also won a 11 billion settlement from a predatory forprofit school for years corinthian profited off the backs of poor people  now they have to pay this judgment sends a clear message there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct said attorney general harris my office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals

6 she pushed for the passage of the homeowners bill of rights in california and won hundreds of millions back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses

7 she recovered hundreds of millions for state pensions from bank of america who mismanaged their investments in 2009 

8 she won 241 million from  company overcharging medical and 323 million from another 

9 she held shipping companies behind an oil spill responsible for 44 million for environmental cleanup fined a company behind a pipeline spill in santa barbara and fined bp and arco 14 million for unsafe oil storage practices

2025-02-11 10:07:13,did globalization just make the free market too efficient for its own good,"ah globalization that grand economic experiment where we were told that free markets would lift all boats make us all richer and turn the world into one big happy trading family at first it worked trade flourished economies grew and capitalists popped champagne but heres where things get tricky

what tends to happen next is less of a fairy tale and more of a thriller once firms grow large enough to wield the magic wand of global supply chains they begin an efficiency quest labour once a stable and locally anchored force becomes a game of arbitragemoving from highwage economies to lowercost regions at first this boosts corporate profits and consumer purchasing power who doesnt love cheap gadgets but soon enough it triggers a paradox the same workers who benefited from cheaper goods suddenly find themselves out of a job because their own wages are now too expensive compared to say a factory in vietnam or a call center in the philippines

this isnt a novel observation dani rodrik in the globalization paradox argues that nations must choose two out of three democracy national sovereignty and hyperglobalizationbut never all three at once when companies chase cheap labour worldwide it weakens the social contract at home destabilizing domestic politics karl polanyi way back in the great transformation predicted that unregulated markets would eventually provoke a political backlash sound familiar

as globalization speeds up firms consolidate economies of scale mean that once an industry starts outsourcing the biggest players outgrow competition at an alarming rate what were left with isnt the efficient free market of adam smiths dreams but rather a handful of corporate behemoths who shape industries dictate wages and set the rules its not capitalism eating itselfits capitalism evolving into oligopoly

and heres where things get dark economic distress fuels political instability laidoff workers unable to transition fast enough to new jobs dont stay quietly unemployed they get angry they vote and not for centrists promising nuanced economic policyno they turn to populists strongmen and disruptors who promise to break the system that failed them protectionism rises economic nationalism takes over and before you know it the world is no longer discussing trade deals but trade wars worse still history suggests economic dislocation is one of the key ingredients for actual wars see the 1930s

so heres my question to you fellow redditors and armchair economists is there a way for economics to selfcorrect before it spirals into geopolitical disaster can we design policies that maintain competitive markets while preventing the economic distortions that lead to instability and war

2 how much military aid in  must be invested to achieve this type of victory  
  
3 how many soldiers would likely lose their lives as a result

2025-02-11 06:41:38,do you believe that trump will try for a third term,"trump declines to endorse vance as 2028 successor which lead me to think how he would run for a third term and he has spoke about it before  

the twentysecond amendment to the united states constitution states that

gtsection 1 no person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice and no person who has held the office of president or acted as president for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president shall be elected to the office of the president more than once but this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of president when this article was proposed by the congress and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of president or acting as president during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of president or acting as president during the remainder of such term

gtsection 2 this article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the constitution by the legislatures of threefourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the congress

then the twelfth amendment to the united states constitution states

gtbut no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vicepresident of the united states

it seems rather clear that a president cannot run for potus after two terms and they are not eligible for being vice president  i think this sets three scenarios for trump becoming president a third time  

option 1 he still runs as president a third time and this may be considered an official act  yes its technically against the us constitution amendment 22 but who would be able to stop him if hes legally protected 

option 2 trump runs for speaker of the house in 2028 supporting the two others for president and vice president on the republican ticket  they resign after being sworn in and trump becomes president again

option 3  the scotus could look into the ratification since you need 75 of states to agree to the amendment  we could see that some states pull their submissions enough to put it under the threshold or challenge the legality of the original submission  the scotus takes the case and makes it legal for them to pull their requests the amendment gets dissolved

2025-02-11 11:48:49,veto referendums are a way to have electors decide on the fate of laws are they a good idea in your mind,"basically imagine that a new bill has been made into law some people are furious and so they get enough signatories to demand a referendum be held on the bill if the voters approve of the bill it remains a law if they dont it is repealed different places have different rules on whether or not the law is provisionally valid pending the vote or not and how many signatories it takes and how long they have to collect them in the 23 american states with them it varies from 15 in massachusetts to 15 of the ballots in the last election and usually 90 days to collect signatures from the end of the session switzerland is a prolific user of this mechanism and in switzerland there is no such thing as a court finding a law unconstitutional the people alone decide whether or not to uphold a law or not

it could also be incorporated into the way it combines with an executive veto icelands presidents veto over bills takes the form of referring the bill to the population to vote on whether or not to sustain the bill this has been used a couple of times notably in the icelandic debt crisis where voters were referred a bill on a restructuring plan and was massively defeated with 98 of the voters opposing the bill with 62 turnout in argentina if the president vetoes a bill and the congress cant get 23 support in both houses to override but can get majority support the bill goes to a referendum for judgement you think this is a good idea",Awesomeuser90,PoliticalDiscussion,28,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1imws59/veto_referendums_are_a_way_to_have_electors/

the first question does any of this matter sure this will clearly not poll well but is it actual salient or important to voters  average voters have shown to have both a large tolerance of trumps breaking of laws and norms and a very poor view of our current system  voters voted for trump despite the explicit claims that trump will put the constitution of this country at risk  they either dont believe trump is actually a threat or believe that the guardrails will always hold  but americans love america and a constitutional crisis hits at the core of our politics  will voters only care if it affects them personally  will trump be rewarded for breaking barriers to achieve the goals that he says voters sent him to the white house to achieve  what can democrats do to gain support besides either falling back on trump is killing democracy or defending very unpopular institutions",Visco0825,PoliticalDiscussion,585,418,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1imkhgi/is_the_current_potential_constitutional_crisis/

that level of organization and preparedness is something progressives must learn from having the right ideas isnt enough they need leaders who can execute communicate and work together they need a project 2027

  

so who are the candidates local state and federal that strike the right balance young energetic forwardthinking and capable of working in unison rather than being fragmented  



aside from the candidates themselves how do they actually make this happen whats the best strategy for

 identifying and supporting the right candidates early  
 building a coalition that can work in unison instead of being divided  
 creating a messaging strategy that resonates with the majority not just the base  
 ensuring grassroots efforts translate into real electoral success  
 learning from past mistakes and building an infrastructure that lasts  



who are the rising stars that actually get it who has the vision the fire and the ability to win and govern effectively without falling into the same divisions of the past  

drop names key races and reasons progressives should get behind them  



prompts because im not going to lie i had chatgtp help me put this together due to being dumb  

 new reddit post political discussion the prompt  title something like which candidates should progressives be pushing to the front page lifting up or just overall supporting for 2026 and the future that are likely to advance progressive like truly star trek progressive policies in unison and quickly

 we may need to rethink our post we want drastic change young and eager candidates but we also want candidates that are appealing to the majority

 add a neutral mention that the current party has been if nothing else extremely efficient or prepared to implement their policy

 these candidates must also be able to work in unison not as divided as they have been in the past softer on progressive

 we need to change the policies into more of a discussion topic something else to plan

 scrap the policies replace with a discussion on how to actually implement our plan",muchhuman,PoliticalDiscussion,172,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ikuesi/who_are_the_young_bold_and_electable_candidates/
2025-02-08 16:58:01,how will the increasing diversity in the republican voter base impact its future,"trumps voter base in 2024 was more diverse than many people expected with many key groups like black americans latinos asians and jews shifting to the right politically college educated people and young men have also shifted to the right they didnt all go for trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years 

cities and their suburbs traditionally democratic strongholds have begun voting more republican too this could be important as rural america is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas by 2050 89 of the american population is projected to live in urbansuburban areas up from 83 right now i think these are things that could shape what the republican party becomes in the future and what their priorities are

the archetype of a republican voter has traditionally been an older white person from a rural area but as time goes on this could change

we dont know if these changes are only for 2024 or if its a broader trend that will be more permanent since these groups may become a bigger part of the republican electorate how do you think this will affect the future of conservative politics in the united states if it kept going this direction would this curb the influence of far right extremist groups like white nationalists

also despite the increased racial diversity two groups that shifted further away from republicans were women and the lgbtq community so it will be interesting to see how that develops i wonder if the divide will shift from race to more about sexuality

2025-02-08 20:21:54,why do white supremacists have so much freedom in the united states,"in the united states the first amendment to the constitution protects free speech almost absolutely allowing white supremacist groups neonazis and other farright organizations to demonstrate publicly without government intervention as long as they do not directly incite violence why has this legal protection allowed events such as the rightwing unity march in charlottesville in 2017 where neonazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as jews will not replace us to take place without prior restrictions how is it possible that in multiple us cities demonstrations by groups like the ku klux klan or the neonazi militia patriot front are allowed while in countries like germany where nazism had its origins hate speech including the swastika and the nazi salute has been banned

throughout history the us has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence as happened in the 1970s with the nazi party of america case in skokie illinois where the supreme court ruled in favor of the right of neonazis to march in a community of holocaust survivors why does us law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika the confederate flag or the naziinspired sonnenrad sun wheel despite being linked to hate crimes what role do factors such as lobbying by farright groups the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness

in addition fbi 2022 2023 studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years why despite intelligence agencies warning that rightwing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity what responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members to what extent does the first amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech

i ask all this with respect with no intention to offend or attack any society the question is based on news that have reached me and different people around the world here are some of these news items

 charlottesville virginia reels from deadly white nationalist rally
 unity rally in howell pushes back on recent white supremacy demonstrations

this leads me to my question  will there be a backlash for this  how will it occur  how can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement  it seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response

a russian tail is a statistical anomaly often observed in elections with suspected fraud normally vote distributions follow a smooth bell curve but in some cases an extra spike appearssuggesting that votes may have been shifted in specific precincts this pattern has been documented in russian elections georgia elections and and some watchdog groups claim to have seen similar anomalies in romania most recently there were independent journalists and analysts that reported they noticed the same anomalies in the november 2024 us election

with all the concerns about election integrity and foreign interferenceespecially disinformation campaigns aimed at making people distrust resultsdo you think statistical anomalies like this could impact public confidence in the us electoral process even if fraud isnt proven does simply showing these data patterns create enough doubt to destabilize democracy

back in 2009 after barack obama came into office a much different media environment existed where the flock of young staffers policy gurus and even techies from what was then a mostly democratic silicon valley were praised and given supportive backing by many of the same journalist outlets the profiles were largely about how these eager college grads would transform government and bring it into the 21st century while also repudiating anything under the then despised outgoing president george w bush

2025-02-02 05:10:48,considering the similarities between bushcheney admin 200109 and the current trump administration do you believe musk whos got both 159 b in contracts and a couple of lawsuits with government agencies is attempting to pull a cheney and if so do you believe he could succeed,"i was thinking about the similarities between the two presidents and the closest person to them who stand a lot to gain and have undoubtedly are very influential in their decision making  and i dont think in hindsight many americans and members of the legislative branch would still be on board for the invasion of iraq if they knew how it would turn out particularly regarding the nobid government contracts with halliburton to manage the oilfields after saddams regime fell 

so im curious if you believe musk is attempting to be cheney 20 and if musk were trying to do something similar to cheney by exerting influence on the presidents policymaking do you think the legislative branch would be able to prevent it in an effort to avoid a repeat of what happened during the bush administration why or why not

if not do you believe it is within the realm of possibility that trump and musk are instead working in tandem to attempt something akin to state capture and could that be successful or will the legislative check their executive power and prevent policymaking that seems primarily to benefit musk and trump and clearly detrimental for the american people",MrsBigglesworth-_-,PoliticalDiscussion,91,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ifpwve/considering_the_similarities_between_bushcheney/

under xavier becerra and dr rachel levine obesity rates continued to rise particularly among children despite obesity being one of the leading contributors to chronic disease no major policy shifts were implemented to combat the dominance of ultraprocessed foods or improve national dietary standards meanwhile some argue that the approach to obesity has shifted toward body positivity and weight inclusivity rather than stricter public health interventions like dietary regulations calorie control or exercisefocused initiatives others believe that body positivity is an important movement that helps reduce stigma and improve mental health outcomes

at the same time levines nomination was largely framed in terms of representation as she became the first openly transgender federal official confirmed by the senate critics argue that this emphasis on identity shielded her from scrutiny over her policies or personal health while others see it as an important milestone in diversity and inclusion meanwhile rfk jr is facing an aggressive confirmation process largely due to his views on vaccines and alternative health approaches this raises a question does political or social alignment influence how much scrutiny a public health official receives

was the level of scrutiny rfk jr faced during his confirmation hearing proportional especially when past health secretaries like rachel levine and xavier becerra received far less aggressive questioning despite overseeing rising obesity rates and unaddressed concerns about processed food",DecentForever343,PoliticalDiscussion,34,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1iew3yo/public_health_body_positivity_and_political/

2025-01-31 13:44:53,in general what is the democratic position on edward snowden and mass surveillance programs,"edward snowden has been in the news recently the senate intelligence committee is conducting hearings to review the nomination of tulsi gabbard to be the director of national intelligence in these hearings there have been some intense exchanges regarding edward snowden 

gabbard acknowledged that snowdens actions were illegal and she committed to preventing any such leaks in the future however she declined to call him a traitor after multiple democratic senators demanded that she do so some democratic senators seemed to feel that her sympathy for snowden should disqualify her for the role 

in light of these hearings it leads one to wonder what are the democratic views towards edward snowden and the mass surveillance program that he revealed is there widespread agreement among democrats that snowden is a traitor does the democratic party broadly support the surveillance programs 

edward snowden says that he was inspired to leak the information after watching james clapper deny the existence of these surveillance programs how do democrats feel about previous attempts to hide the existence of these programs 

the democratic members of the senate intelligence committee seemed to have strong negative feelings towards snowden is this a bias of the senate intelligence committee or is this a feeling that democrats hold generally 

what is the democratic position on mass surveillance programs is this view consistent with their views in previous decades or have the views of the party changed from what they were during the george w bush administration",damndirtyape,PoliticalDiscussion,387,131,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1ief3co/in_general_what_is_the_democratic_position_on/
2025-01-30 19:03:19,how best do you think governance can take advantage of citizens assemblies,"athens is known for being a progenitor of democracy but athens did not elect most of its officials the main ones who were would have been the strategoi generals note that those who were voting were also its civil militia and they would have been soldiers too who knew what battle was like the boule had hundreds of members chosen by lot having been elected in big batches drawing some of those elected to the boule and this functioned as the governing senate of athens juries of 201 501 1001 and 1501 people were also common with the presiding magistrate also chosen by lot they viewed elections as a risky way to govern a polity given that people could be bribed or intimidated to vote a certain way or otherwise to elect people who were risky people but nobody could bribe the gods to choose one person over another in the drawing of lots and an assembly of hundreds of people with time and ability to deliberate and seek information could make decisions likely to be representative of the whole people and not concerned over the short term political wish to be reelected or to otherwise climb in power

in the modern era we have juries with jurors who are biased struck from the pool before the trial commences but that isnt the only opportunity to use random chance some countries have turned to the idea of lottery to choose a large panel of people to deliberate on issues where it is seen that politicians might not be so good at especially issues related to the rules of how politicians get put in office in the first place in british columbia 19 years ago a citizens assembly recommended a voting reform that was put to referendum and agreed to by 57 of voters but the threshold had been set at 60 which was widely denounced as unconstitutional and illegitimate given that no such threshold was used to put the current system of voting into place and so why could it be legitimate to need 60 to change it 

ireland used a citizens assembly to consider several issues pertaining to whether snap elections can happen and if so how how climate change reactions could occur abortion laws how pensions could be dealt with and a few other things they did divide over a few issues but many votes actually had quite strong consensus for months they listened to people who presented their views including experts members of the public affected people members of the government etc 

in principle a citizens assembly could be given the power to compel information too from witnesses and to compel evidence too or to demand a government official testify under oath on pain of perjury for lying or misleading them maybe they could do a budget analysis and plan and suggest that to the legislature or executive they rarely have the power to make a binding decision of policy but they may have their recommendation referred to a legislature or executive or the people for ratification maybe they could even be a third house of a legislature even if it is more advisory or its decisions need approval by the people or the other houses to become policy or law",Awesomeuser90,PoliticalDiscussion,47,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1idulcx/how_best_do_you_think_governance_can_take/

my second question is about hollys statements around her previous statements being those of a professional advocate are professional advocates required to tell the truth and is it supposed to be understood that an advocate is just acting as if they care about the subject matter they are advocating even if they dont themselves believe in what they are saying are they paid to convince others of something they may not be convinced of themselves are there any legal protections for the statements or actions of an advocate where they can say in a court room that they lied or committed a crime before but its ok because they were acting as an advocate rather than being themselves",StudentOk6301,PoliticalDiscussion,27,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1icx5rk/why_is_senator_ted_cruz_asking_circuit_judge/

this may not seem like a lot but white voters are a majority of the electorate and disproportionately powerful in the electoral college so even this small swing if sustainable could have very serious ramifications for future elections even if it wasnt enough to save harris in 2024  

but is this sustainable  or is it a peculiar product of the trump era that will go away once hes no longer on the ballot  
  
it seems that it may be worth thinking about who these voters are  are these welloff suburban whites who are socially progressive but economically more conservative romney republicans who will come home to the gop  or is this a more longterm demographic change as more conservative older white voters are replaced by more progressive white voters from younger but now becoming middle aged generations

really one of the most interesting questions is why this shift only started showing up after 2016  that makes it seem like whatever is happening is more complex than just trump himself being in the mix  what do you think is the explanation and what does it portend for the future

for a country as diverse and multifaceted as the united states is it realisticor even beneficialto align strictly with one side of the political spectrum can we find ways to value compromise and shared goals without abandoning our principles

in leadership for example its possible to respect someones achievements or policies even if we dont agree with their rhetoric or personal values this perspective challenges the idea that political affiliation defines the entirety of someones worth as a leader when we judge based solely on party lines we may miss opportunities to learn from or work with individuals who could otherwise contribute to progress

	1	wouldnt adding so many people to the unemployment rolls be a significant issue has anyone considered the impact on local businessesshops restaurants coffee shops and other servicesthat rely on these federal employees as customers the job losses could extend far beyond the federal workforce as many countries saw during the pandemic shutdowns and work from home
	2	what happens to these people when they lose their health insurance and livelihoods does the administration have a plan to offset this does the us have an unemployment insurance program
	3	who will perform these jobs and deliver the services that americans rely on will everything grind to a halt or will these be positions that are really unnecessary
	4	if these cuts are truly political will cutting these services hurt trumps supporters as well wouldnt they be negatively affected by reduced government assistance or fewer public services
	5	are there any plans to help these displaced employees find new jobs will the economy be able to absorb them

2025-01-26 20:49:20,how did the generation that once created powerful political protest music come to embrace trump,"in the 1960s and 1970s music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest songs like bob dylans the times they are achangin edwin starrs war and the beatles revolution became anthems for change speaking directly to the injustices of the time  civil rights struggles the vietnam war and economic inequality these songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future

fast forward to today and many members of the baby boomer generationthe very ones who helped create this powerful musicare now among the most ardent supporters of donald trump this is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism injustice and the excesses of the elite
some examples of iconic political songs from that era

		bob dylan  the times they are achangin 1964 this song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift urging people to embrace change and fight for justice

		edwin starr  war 1970 a powerful antivietnam war anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it

		the beatles  revolution 1968 a song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time

		buffalo springfield  for what its worth1966 a protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country often interpreted as a critique of government repression

these songs werent just catchy tunes they were calls to action social commentary and even direct criticism of the establishment
so heres the question how did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s

is it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment a result of shifting political landscapes or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group

2025-01-25 12:39:19,can true meritocracy work,"the question has two parts

part a is it actually possible

is the idea of meritocracy really possible or is it a utopia only in paper note that meritocracy differs significantly from socialism since socialismmarxism provides equality for everyone regardless of their wealth or talent but meritocracy favors talent over wealth it agrees with socialism on disregard for inherited wealth but argues people should be given opportunities based on their merit which is talent intelligence or even beauty i believe the idea is romanticized in many cyberpunk settings such as metropolis 1927 and the matrix 1999 dystopian societies where rich people are rewarded and poor talented people are discriminated it criticizes both capitalism and marxism

problem 1 who determines whos worthy and whos not government corporates and who chooses them

problem 2 what defines merit what is the standard of being intelligenttalented

problem 3 how can we make sure corruption does not happen and reach true meritocracy

problem 4 should genetic traits such as intelligence strength and beauty only be rewarded or acquired traits such as hard work should be too

part b if its possible is it a good thing

lets say somehow we get close to the idea of true meritocracy but is this a good thing for a society if youre good in something youll be rewarded but people with average intelligencecapability will have many challenges maybe we can work on giving the average citizen a descent livable life but even then is it moral

pros

 talentless rich people are given the same starting point as talented poor people where the latter can shine

 if hard work is rewarded too then only you decide your fate there is no excuse for poverty

 if done correctly social injustice rarely happens everyone gets what they deserve good people live well average people live averagely and bad people live badly

cons

 talentless people whatever defines that will live harshly theyre humans too

as for reforms i would usually think of some power for the minority to get information and to ask questions but ultimately let the majority vote i would also think of transferring the power to the house not senate codification of some steps like a background check and the application submitted could be helpful as could more disclosure of the process used by the president to choose who to nominate in the first place can you think of others

several members of the presidents inner circle such as steve bannon have also advocated for this

this discussion has finally culminated in a proposal to amend the constitution introduced this week by representative andy ogles rtn the amendment would alter the language of the constitution so that a president who has not yet served two consecutive terms can continue running for president this would allow trump to run in 2028 as he had two terms already but they were nonconsecutive conversely someone like clinton bush or obama would not qualify to run again since they served two consecutive terms

the amendment is largely considered to be an extreme long shot that has no chance of winning support from republicans let alone democrats and will likely die in the house however the increasing rhetoric around a possible third term leads to the question of whether president trump would or could try explore options to stay in office from 2028 onwards what avenues are available for him to do this if he does what political response would he receive from the federal bureaucracy the military fellow republicans democrats and the individual states",premeddit,PoliticalDiscussion,760,652,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1i8ztrc/an_amendment_has_been_introduced_in_the_house_of/

when trump unexpectedly won in 2016 he and the maga movement were relatively weak within the gop and had no plan for government therefore the gop establishment subcontracted the cabinet many legislative proposals and judicial nominees trumps first cabinet included mike pompeo jeff sessions bill barr and john bolton paul ryan drafted the laws that trump enacted such as the tax cuts mitch mcconnell and the federalist society handpicked the judicial nominees

if trump had won in 2020 there would have been no january 6 moment where those republicans disloyal to trump such as liz cheney adam kinzinger mitt romney as well as the other nevertrumpers were excommunicated from the party this would mean that magas influence in the gop had some opposition additionally trump would not have been under criminal investigation in several jurisdictions which fired up the base more importantly trump had four years to plan for government this time see project 2025 and agenda 47

additionally trump would have presided over the postcovid inflation surge hence the gop may have struggled in 2022 and lost the presidency in 2024 trump would have been termlimited hence the gop nominee would have been someone else this may have been the moment when the establishment republicans took back control of their party from maga

now the gop is firmly under trumps and magas control additionally trumps ban on social media after january 6 indirectly led to musk buying twitter big tech has shifted in favour of trump which may not have happened if trump had won in 2020

2025-02-17 06:50:08,is this really a justifiable cut,"ive been on board with cuts and investigation the trump administration has been doing but im having a hard time understanding how this one is helpful im heartily in favor of funding scientific research this is limiting lab and equipment expenditures a necessary part of that research 

im not saying there arent issues with the nih that should be addressed for one theres loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public publicly funded research should be required to be published but this isnt addressing that 

if theres corruption or conflict of interest issues wouldnt requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution and firing those that abuse it not this 

if its that we dont want to waste money on pointless studies wouldnt a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution

the only other argument ive seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money but do we know that and if so how ive seen a couple of comments on youtube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for not a very official source i know  where else can i look into that

2025-02-17 01:07:13,new rules and changes  and brief explanations,"we have 2 new rules that may be consolidated or adjusted youll have to excuse my boomerishness but with new reddit and some other changes i still prefer old reddit some of what we used to do has shifted some of these thing i think can be coded but i am learning how again forgive my ignorance

anyway one major problem that we have had in the past is that videos text posts and image posts if unchecked were often troll posts that not only meant to mock us but also intended to get us shut down if some bad actors on alt accounts created racist memes to throw on our sub and we werent diligent enough in taking them down the sub could get shut down 

that is why we only allowed article posts from the subs inception and it remained an unspoken rule but things started shifting and there were little changes to posts that reddit made and then new reddit happened and we mods just didnt adjust to the times perhaps thats my excuse anyway

people started posting links in text posts which i thought was a mistake and we tried to correct it but it was just a pain in the ass they started posting text commentary under articles which never used to happen

so the issue is thus too little oversight into posts leads to

 shit posts and i mean shit
 trolls having too easy a time to troll
 bad actors using bad posts to try and get us shut down or promote brigading that just ruins the experience of our users

these new rules are to force commentary where it belongs in the comment section if you want to make a comment about your article just make it in the comment section dont change the title to comment on an article and dont comment on the article in any body section i think i changed that so you wont be able to

forcing the commentary into the comment section allows you users to protect from the problems that that causes while allowing for the same commentary so do not complain about free speech on this front protestors have to follow rules too they are supposed to get permits they are not allowed to just disrupt everything at least anywhere other than blue cities

this also prevents an annoying trend ive been seeing where users post a link to google not a google article not some app on google to comment on the app in some relevant way just posting a link to google so that they can then make a comment in what becomes a text post

hopefully i have removed that ability so the rule is moot

we also hope to allow more things like text posts video posts and other posts but that requires moderation i cant tell you how many times such posts in the past were used to troll brigade and try to hurt us an innocuous photo of trump and the first lady one posted here had a photoshopped silhouette of the twin towers on fire in the patter of melanias dress or trumps tie i forget which it was a troll post

there may be setting changes to do some of this automatically and i think there are but im new to this part of moderating so the rule doesnt even matter because it wont be possible to break these rules

that said i would also like you to know why we limit the kinds of posts we allow",MikeyPh,Republican,0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1ir7u5b/new_rules_and_changes_and_brief_explanations/

2025-02-16 14:31:13,clarification on what antirepublican means  also just some tips on being decent,"i covered leftist talking points in the last announcements and ill take that down once it seems the leftists trolls and bots have abated for the time being but i wanted to discuss what it means to break our antirepublican rule along with our reagans 11th commandment rule because they are basically the same rule

im going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users

i was just stating a fact what facts arent allowed anymore

facts are allowed they have always been allowed and even encouraged but if your fact is laced with commentary then it is not longer just a fact here are some examples

 fact the sky is blue

 what gets you banned the sky is blue you fucking fascist

take note because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say i was just stating a fact this is so common its not funny

heres another one

 fact musk and trump are uncovering a lot of fraud while mistakes are being made they are also being corrected and musk only has the power to report findings not make final decisions

 what will get you banned musk and trump man these guys are running amok im deeply concerned about how musk is just firing people

do you see the difference one is a fact one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth many users do not see the difference be a user who does

just because i dont suck trumps dick means im antirepublican i have been registered republican for x number of years

this is one we get a lot you must understand that we are a large umbrella there are maga republicans there are trump supporters who love trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow there are republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party

we dont care what category you fall under what we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members

if you dont like the memes of trump fine but dont trash people who do and if you think it makes us look bad i would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride they memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thingthe character assassination attempts they did to trump they also did to romney to mccain to bush jr to bush sr they accused clarence thomas of rape just like kavanaugh this is the lefts mo and it has been for longer than ive been alive arguably since before the civil war

you dont have to like the memes president trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting i dont particularly like them myself but to trash fellow republicans for it without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades is disrespectful to your fellow republicans

you can argue it makes us look bad but do so with respect

 whats acceptable i dont like this meme and doesnt think it helps our cause but i can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades

 whats not acceptable the magas who suck trumps dick love this shit but it makes us look bad

i would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left i know you care about looking bad to the left but how about looking bad to your fellow party comments like the one just above make you look bad to me and many of your fellow republicans

show respect

insert prominent republicans name is a piece of shit hes a traitor to the party

i am a christian first a member of my family second an american third and a republican lower on the list i hope all of your have a similar hierarchy political parties are not the beall and endall 

political parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with they have value in the situations but i kind of hate that they exist

that said being a sub for the party although we are not affiliated with the gop in any official capacity we are just fellow republicans we do need to show deference to the party we need to respect the party we need to respect the umbrella and we need to respect the individuals in the party

i am not a fan of romney but i respect that he is a republican so if i criticize him i might have a little fun but i wont just trash him keep in mind would you rather the left win or have a insert republican you dont like in my case id rather have a romney than an obama

 what is acceptable romney doesnt feel all that republican to me these days and i really dont like how he keeps breaking from republicans on so many issues to the point id call him a rino but hes a strong business man and id take him over obama any day

 what is not fuck that loser romney hes a rino piece of shit i dont trust him

do you see the difference one way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because its so disrespectful

we need solidarity that does not mean we accept traitors if indeed we have any but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow republicans like crap we dont throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must we dont cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible if they are indeed a rino show the receipts but be respectful

matt gaetz is a prime example the right thing to do was to cut ties with him but not before allegations were credible enough especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before and also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just havent been caught he shouldnt have done what he seems to have done and its inexcusable but it also seems like a political targeting both of those things can be true at the same time

we dont jump down a republicans throat at the first accusation of impropriety we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having clarence thomas or brett kavanaugh on the bench we wouldnt have trump and think about how many it worked on it worked on romney it worked on bork look him up it worked on so many others this is the lefts mo they tried to get rid of hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes dont buy their hysterics let the facts come out

2025-02-11 23:04:31,do not feed the trolls and leftists  a few points to remember in this strange and awesome time,"first of all we are being inundated just like every time trump wins or is impeached or is shot at by trolls by curious left leaning folks and i assume by bots

do not engage them report them i have seen too many posts or comments upvoted that a republican wouldnt upvote or at least they wouldnt if they knew what was happening with that comment

i just banned a user who came in saying something that seems righteous but was an underhanded trashing of the right we shouldnt label or call the left names that is leading to divide it sounds kinda nice civility is important none of us want war or violence or anything of the sort but to come in here and act as if we are the uncivil ones indicates to me that you are either

 a lefty posing as a republican to bullshit us and try to underhandedly sway us in a pathetic passive aggressive way
 a romneyesque republican who has appeased the left far too much over the years while criticizing his own party far too much as well
 or a republican who doesnt have any idea how bad the usaid stuff is because you are listening far too much to media that has largely been coopted by the democrats

by the way we do expect our users to be civil but we also give our users some latitude in our sub because this is our place to discuss politics with fellow republicans i would not expect people in the democrat subs to refrain from referring to us in derogatory ways but still there are lines and if our users cross them we will ban them

folks we try really really hard not to draw lines and define what a republican is the party is a large umbrella there are libertarian republicans there are republicans who are very conservative socially there are republicans who are gay there are republicans who believe in abolishing the fed and ones who just want to reform it there are republicans who are muslim asian black hispanic even trans and i have to give a special thank all to all those minorities for voting trump it is so hard to go against the stranglehold the democrats have had on minority voters for so long i cant imagine how it feels to vote trump when your whole family and everyone around you is saying youre a traitor or something but you had the courage of your convictions and that is amazing

there is room in the republican party for so much we are a huge umbrella

that said we have to draw the line sometimes there are obvious lines like if you are a republican socialist sorry you are not a republican i dont even care if youre legally registered republican socialists do not fit under our umbrella we will ban you for espousing those views here

if you are for mutilation of minors and are technically a republican we will ban you for espousing those views here

we have a rule that says no leftist talking points and we have that not because we are scared of leftist views i mean look at how hard leftist views are failing all over the world theyre bad ideas we have that rule because reddit is 90 left and we hear their views all the time there views are inescapable we couldnt live in a bubble on reddit if we tried i was just blasted on a design sub because someone posted what they thought was a clever design and it was basically a trump is hitler sign and i said can this sub of all subs be nonpolitical is that possible i wasnt banned but i was told that when fascists arent endangering our rights then maybe they wouldnt have to get political such wieners

this leads to another reason for that rule we were largely forced out of the neutral spaces long ago subs like rpolitics rnews rworldnews they are all run by leftists and they are swarming with leftists who will down vote and berate anyone who comes in with even just a mildly conservative or prorepublican idea or in my case just a proneutrality comment so we were largely forced out except for those republicans who the hardcore leftists like because they say things that the lefties think are reasonable

if you are a republican who blames us for the bad rhetoric when for over 40 years we have been called racists nazis and bigots and for much of that time we took it in stride then you are so deluded you are not a republican and we cant have you here because you are espousing leftist talking points

if you are a republican who blames us for the tension when we were being skipped over by fema for supporting trump then you are not a republican and we cant have you here youll be banned for leftist talking points

if you are a republican who says hey guys lets chill and stop saying the democrat party is corrupt as hell for using the fbi to target our candidates for using the irs to target conservatives for pressuring their buddies in banking to not do business with conservatives for using usaid to funnel money to the democrats for using the presidency to garner favor with china for getting their buddies in big tech to censor us for challenging the covid narrative which we were literally right about on every count for supporting and funding the blm riots which destroyed so many small business and property then you are not a republican and we cant have you here those are leftist talking points and they are also absurd

we consider people who blame us for the tension to be antirepublican and spewing leftist talking points but we do understand that some on our side do not help the situation we will ban those who do so dangerously but will we not ban people for using the typical names we call the lefties in our circles

we dont expect users to lavish republicans with praise you can disagree with republicans you can call out republicans for wrong doing but do so with respect to your fellow republicans and for petes sake do not paint a false equivalency that the left and right are just as bad right now

i would ask our users again to help us by reporting those users and calling them out

many of them will have comments that are upvoted because the lefties love swarming our sub especially when they have so soundly been beaten",MikeyPh,Republican,118,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/1inc8y3/do_not_feed_the_trolls_and_leftists_a_few_points/

secure the border finish building the wall and deport illegal aliens
deweaponize the federal government by increasing accountability and oversight of the fbi and doj
unleash american energy production to reduce energy prices
cut the growth of government spending to reduce inflation
make federal bureaucrats more accountable to the democratically elected president and congress

2025-02-10 19:28:12,canada why,"canada why

for several months trump has floated the idea that canada should join the usa as the 51st state 
so lets set aside the fact that canada will never willingly do that 

but is it actually a good idea 

the population of canada is just north of 40m which is more than cali so adding them would give them more state representatives than cali currently has and they would likely be mostly democrats if the house stayed at 435 that would mean that most states would lose representatives and some republicans would likely be replaced by democrats so this would make it harder for a republican house to exist given how tight the house is right now 
same thing on the senate they would likely elect 2 dem senators and again making it harder for gop to hold the senate 
now if they up the reps that will make the gops situation worse since most of the new reps would be dems so instead an evenish split in the house we might just have 40 new dem and 10 new gop reps 

but we probably wouldnt be adding canada as one large state it would make more sense to add each province as a state which wouldnt affect the representatives much but would widely swing the senate dem given that the 20 new senators would like be 15 dem to 5 gop or similar 

trump trying to take ownership of canada doesnt make answer sense if he wants to keep the republican party alive let alone the maga republicans 

i want to be clear this isnt antitrump im just trying to figure out why we would do this given that it would likely swing the political pendulum to the democrats and possibly for a long time",CaptPotter47,Republican,58,26,http://Www.canada.com

us president donald trump has defended elon musk saying the billionaire is terrific and is not gaining anything from his work for the white house

musk has been tasked with slashing government costs by leading the department of government efficiency doge which is not an official government department

some of doges moves are the subject of lawsuits most recently after an attempted takeover of secure systems at the treasury department

trump allies and democrats have been doing the rounds on us morning television and doge has been the major talking point

meanwhile bbcs us partner cbs news has conducted a poll on how americans view trumps administration you can read more here

2025-02-09 21:40:18,gb news britain needs doge how elon musk is cutting billions in waste including a sesame street play in iraq,"nigel farage is looking on in envy at washington dc

in donald trumps first twoweeks as president he began a programme of mass deportations cut billions in government waste leveraged tariffs on mexico and canada removed top fbi officials ended dei in the federal government and fired tens of thousands of government bureaucrats

stephen k bannon an ally of the president described this period as days of thunder to many conservatives president trump has done more for their cause in twoweeks than a string of top republican politicians have achieved in twodecades one of the most successful initiatives has been the creation of the department for government efficiency known as doge led by elon musk musk claims to have cut more than a billion dollars in spending every day and has taken aim at various taxpayerfunded programmes in particular those promoting diversity equity and inclusion dei

if the coming weeks unfold as they have since trumps inauguration then no american president since franklin d roosevelts legendary first 100 days has done more to reshape the nation

since the birth of the welfare state and fdrs transformative expansion of the us government in the 1930smarked by his controversial alphabet agencies aimed at revitalising the economy after the great depressionconservatives and libertarians have continuously fought against this revolution championing small government instead and ever since the 1930s the size of the government has only ever gone in one direction it has grown this was true under democrat and republican presidents alike including ronald raegan and donald trump in his first term

the government has become so bloated that the us national debt has reached 3622 trillion with its annual deficit standing at a whopping 18 trillion elon musk has pledged to cut trillions in waste and fraud a lofty goal which will be difficult to reach however the tesla ceo has already identified billions spent on programmes he says are surplus to requirement these include the tens of billions spent on usaid to projects around the world some of which are absurd

among the projects funded by american taxpayers via usaid are 20 million for a sesame street show in iraq 70000 for a dei musical in ireland 2 million for moroccan pottery classes and 6 million to promote tourism in egypt doge has already cut down the agencys employees from more than 14000 to just hundreds of critical staff and trump has tweeted promising to shut down the entire department

doge operates with elon musk at its head and a series of young men underneath him musk has 20 staff operating in doge most of whom are men in their early 20s including one who is just 19

these men are equivalent to dominic cummings misfits and weirdos who worked in number 10 during boris johnsons premiership musk believes he can hire autistic geniuses to work day and night to go through the federal budget with a knife the team is using ai algorithms to search for waste which is surely required when one takes into account the size of us government spending one member of the team won a prestigious prize worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for using ai to translate ancient roman texts which were previously believed to be unreadable they have the political backing of the president and his cabinet as well as much of congress for the first time since the new deal there seems to be a republican president who meant it when he said he wanted a smaller more efficient state",coinfanking,Republican,5,37,https://channel8.com/english/31152

from my perspective i think he did a good job overall as with every president id say he handled some things were very well and some were very disappointing but overall he was good just real quickly the very good things in my opinion were his economic recovery after covid curbing inflation handling ukraine infvesting in infrastructure and green initiatives very bad was the afghanistan exit strategy and an overly aggressive strategy to move towards electric vehicles

2025-02-06 00:51:57,why are all these immigration protests calling out the executive office,"i find it ironic that all of these immigration protests are specifically against the executive branch the executive branch is just enforcing the laws that are on the books specifically title 8 

if people want to change the laws on the books why are they not protesting against the house of representatives the house is the branch that is charged with writing bills into law so if people want to change the laws they should be protesting against the legislative branch 

additionally why were there no protests against obama when he was president obama deported 409849 in 2012 alone his administration deported more people in one term than trump did in his first term 

to me if there is so much momentum for immigration reform which i agree that there should be reform why is no one holding up signs calling out their local congressman or congresswoman  this is an ideal time for congress to use the support of the people to put forth a meaningful immigration reform law 

the last meaningful immigration reform was passed in 1996 which is almost 30 years ago if people really wanted change they should step up and have congress amend the law to reflect their opinions seems like common sense to me and is long overdue 

none of the interviews or people protesting in the  50501 protests even mention their local elected officials all the focus is on the executive branch",BarzyBear,Republican,44,69,https://www.kcra.com/article/protests-against-trump-project-2025/63675220

us president donald trump and israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu have just hosted a joint news conference at the white house

trump suggested the us could take over gaza and do a real job by removing unexploded bombs and economically redeveloping the palestinian territory into the riviera of the middle east

the us president proposed that palestinians could be resettled outside of gaza while it was rebuilt though countries throughout the middle east have previously rejected this proposal

netanyahu  the first foreign leader to visit in the us presidents second term  said trumps plan was an idea worth paying attention to

the bbcs diplomatic correspondent paul adams writes the us president continues to startle everyone with his proposals for gaza calling it headspinning stuff

trump also said iran cannot have a nuclear weapon and it would be unfortunate if tehran thought it could develop atomic bombs

netanyahu tells his host he is the greatest friend israel has ever had  the two leaders were close allies during trumps first term when he relocated the american embassy to jerusalem a move that palestinians condemned",coinfanking,Republican,38,32,https://www.bbc.com/news/live/clyn05y9x2xt

what kind of logic is this to vandalize someones property and to draw conclusions out on me calling me a nazi thats based on me defending a belief that its unfounded to vandalize the property of 1 someone you dont know 2 purely because you dont like the owner of the company that creates a car you dont like
 
on top of that the person in the video is sacrificing their own well being by doing what they did you can clearly see their reflection they  are not wearing any sort of gear that could prevent recognition of them by this i mean they vandalize a car that has active security monitoring and without any antiidentification gear not even a full face mask wtf how can this possibly be agreeable or considered to be smart",AzureWra1th,Republican,110,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/MildlyVandalised/s/Y3WUCiHRcH

2025-02-01 18:11:06,the media and bad parenting is the problem,"excerpt from one rob hetrick stolen from facebook

all you latinos for trump are getting deported too  

really youre that stupid  did you drop your brain into the toilet and forget to rinse it off before stuffing it back up your ass  

apparently this bit of wisdom flies in the face of something liberals have been saying for years  

illegals cant vote

so how can a latino who voted for trump get deported if theyre all us citizens

they cant 

i spoke to my barber this morning who said her collegeaged daughter came home frantically crying saying she needed to carry her birth certificate with her on campus because ice was coming to college campuses and putting all brown people on buses  shes a natural born us citizen her mother is too so shes not a dreamer who believes that trump is deporting all mexicans to mexico  

can you believe that shit trump has not ended daca  dreamers are not being deported  us citizens are certainly not being deported  

unless they are convicted criminals who have already served their jail time and are being protected by sanctuary cities that refuse to deport them  

the shit that the liberal media is putting out is outrageous  the outright lies that the paid liberal personalities on tiktok instagram etc are putting out is designed to keep these kids freaking the fuck out and reacting to one crisis after another without any let up  that is literally how you radicalize someone 

if youre a parent of a teenage or college age student and youre not sitting down with them and walking them through everything that is happening youre the problem too  its our job to teach our kids how to be independent thinkers and how to apply critical thinking and objective reasoning if youre not maybe you should be deported",tomcat91709,Republican,0,0,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid033fbg3yfUFSGT8bdHDSNwxPFWLTDCS79mNWyvYjByeQAEPRsMpu16Qk98tuXx514Sl&amp;id=100077344690339&amp;mibextid=Nif5oz

look i dont know what is the right path forward the only thing i know is that we as a people a nation need to come together god says to love your neighbor jesus spent most of his time with the lowest of society if god was in our hearts would we not embrace our fellow human if care for human rights was the motivating factor for opposing a political viewpoint would we not also care for the human rights of those whose hearts seem filled with hatred this horrific division between right and left is just distracting us all from the real systemic issues we are all struggling to make a living why cant we work together to solve the problem why must we villainize each other we are all afraid we all want a better country a better government we all want a voice why do we silence each other

as we enter this new era of change let us remember that for better or worse we are in this together we cannot ignore the pain and suffering of one half of the country even if you think they are stupid intolerant spiteful sensitive despicable or blind it does not change what is the choice we do have is how we treat our fellow humans every day jesus was persecuted and ultimately killed the entire time he kept his heart open to the people harming himself and his friendsfollowers he did not perpetuate their hatred and he loved them god loves criminals the sick nonconformists and those with hate filling their hearts if you believe in god follow his example if you believe in human rights make sure you dont play god and decide who is deserving of those rights we are all in this together",unannounced-insanity,Republican,11,0,https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205%3A38-40&amp;version=NIV

the question what do you dofeel when you learn a fact about history that changes how you see everything like it fills in gaps or context in a way that you either werent expecting or really even didnt want to know or accept i just feel an uncomfortable feeling of having been tricked but not by any specific culprit to be upset at and it feels like the victor writes the history thing is so prominent and it feels like it was staring me right in the face so much the whole time and i just really dont know how to feel 

you can watch the video if youre interested as i said i highly recommend but also id like your thoughts on the question even if you dont watch oooo or even comment watch and then come back and follow up thatd be interesting because the question itself is so interesting and if you have other topics in history that made you feel this way do explain",Interesting_Mix3133,Republican,4,8,https://youtu.be/j4kI2h3iotA?si=kbv_GWO6nPg3PNsb

trump sued the facebook and instagram owner in 2021 over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 january capitol riots that year

in july 2024 meta lifted the final restrictions on trumps facebook and instagram accounts in the lead up to us presidential elections

around 22m of the settlement will go to a fund for trumps presidential library according to us media reports

the balance will reportedly be used to cover legal costs and the other plaintiffs who signed on to the lawsuit meta will not admit wrongdoing

the company suspended trumps accounts in 2021 and said that it would ban him from the platforms for at least two years

twitter which is now named x and owned by trump ally elon musk also permanently suspended the president from its platform

after buying the firm for 44bn musk reinstated trumps account in 2022 after a poll he ran on the site narrowly backed the move",coinfanking,Republican,27,137,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79d74nppvpo

its another sign of the house gop conferences push for unity with trump that the conference is being held at trump national doral his golf course and resort near miami


johnson told reporters on monday that he expects to discuss several issues with trump including potentially conditioning wildfire aid to california it comes after trump suggested pairing aid to the liberal stronghold with a crackdown on noncitizen voting


trump has made no secret of his intent to keep a close eye on the republican majorities in the house and senate this year particularly as they discuss how to use their numbers to pass a massive conservative policy overhaul via the budget reconciliation process


by reducing the threshold for senate passage from 60 votes to a 51seat simple majority reconciliation allows a party in control of both congressional chambers to enact sweeping changes provided theyre relevant to budgetary and fiscal policy


a copy of lawmakers schedule obtained by fox news digital shows a heavy focus on reconciliation this week with several closeddoor meetings on the matter scheduled for tuesday

2025-01-24 00:49:15,proof deleted by reddit in 2020 that january 6th was started by antifa see description,"i have been scared to post this for years i screenrecorded these videos to save them after seeing the bans on donald trump going up all over social media these were originally posted just days after january 6th on the original donald trump subreddit which was later banned all the evidence of election fraud and january 6th being orchestrated by antifa was wiped mind you that subreddit which contained so much proof and content was never reinstated  

when i saw platforms like facebook twitter and google banning and censoring content i decided to keep these videos as a record for the future now i am finally part of the silent majority brave enough to post this this evidence should have been used in court the frustration i feel when i think about how big tech and the media erased so much proof silenced us and painted us as villains is overwhelming  

i compiled these videos taken by people on their phones during the january 6th capitol insurrection youll see footage of people identifying antifa members following them talking about them and shouting at them as they broke windows saying what are you doing and trying to stop them  

ive also included videos of police officers appearing to guide people into the capitol watching these its hard not to wonder if the insurrection was started by no one but the left itself orchestrating chaos while mindless maga supporters unknowingly walked into the trap im posting this here so people can see for themselves and consider that maybe things werent as black and white as cnn and other leftleaning media make it seem",Magro18,Republican,64,210,https://youtu.be/YsZRiiXw1nY?feature=shared

2025-02-18 04:03:52,negotiating peace in ukraine cannot be approached like a business negotiation or a settlement it is a criminal trial in the court of global hegemony,"by 2003 at the latest there is no action that ukraine could have taken which possibly would have prevented russia from trying to annex it only speed up the process if too hostile or friendly the act of forcibly annexing territory through military means with the intent to engage in what russia itself anticipated would possibly amount among largest ethnic cleansings in history rivaling the holocaust is a ghastly breach of international law we must all remember that when looking at this situation objectively these are the conditions which we start from putin indisputably at the very minimum at least intend to absorb and ethnically cleanse belarus ukraine and moldova judging by what he has explicitly writtennote source is the kremlin because its literally what putin wrote the us has  279 billion in aid since  start of the war 2014 to fix damages caused by russia in ukraine according from the numbers provided by the us russia has caused by some lenient estimates as little as over 500 billion feb 2024 damage to ukraineas of this time last year admittedly in addition to that ukraine has done some damage in kursk but unfortunately i could not find a reliable source quantifying that  same with the total cost caused as a direct result of things russia has done since 2024 so while i dont have a number it is very unlikely to exceed 1 billion and in reality is probably closer to half a trillion  

note source is the cannot be linked as reddit wont allow links to it but this is directly from article by vladimir putin on the historical unity of russians and ukrainians  as posted on the kremlins website

i think it is worth talking about concessions in the context of the negotiation a concession is when you give up something you had if i get taken to court for committing tax fraud owing 700000 in upaid taxes i dont get to go in and demand a house that is ridiculous  i broke the law

this is the only starting point that reflects the fact that russia and russia alone broke the law but also does not punish russia or hold them accountable and goes as close as possible to the prewar state

gtukraine leave kursk constitutionally commit to neutrality as it was prior to the invasion

gtrussia leave the entire territory of ukraine crimea included pay ukraine 700 billion and pay 179 billion to the us for damage which was caused by russia in ukraine sanction north korea and stop trading with them

gtthe us lifts most sanctions on russia not all forgives ukraine 10 billion in loans

every other possible alternative requires one side to give something up the above deal is literally the only outcome where nobody concedes anything  without any punishment levied on russia any other deal can be seen as a measurement of how much a country assesses its comparative ability to project power by the measure of how much has conceded v won and this means that under the best possible view of trumps plan the us would get russia to agree to the following concessions none the us would indicate to the world and show china and nato that it assesses that compared to russia the us has no leverage whatsoever and must adhere to russian demands especially in areas that are rightfully russias because the us does not believe it is capable of asking russia to pay for anything admit responsibility for anything and also offers to give russia things and concede on direct threats to the uss own national security in addition to almost 200 billion

any outcome in which russia does not make a single concession is a victory for russia any outcome where ukraine is not given substaintial concessions from russia is a reflection on the ability of the us to influence through primarily hard power the rules and norms of international law should the us get russia to commit withdrawing from kharkiv and kherson and pay the us 50 billion for damages it caused in ukraine that the us paid to fix and recommit to sactioning north korea and in exchange ukraine concede all of the occupied territories the us would be conceding responsibility for at least 129 billion in damages caused by russia and conceding what trump has identified as a core strategic interest in allowing north korea to gain access to markets through russia and ukraine would be conceding their territorial integrity part of its sovereignty and financially take responsiblity for 700 billion in damages caused by russia this should be obviously categorically unacceptable for ukraine and ridiculous for the us

the fact that the starting point the us is approaching what frighteningly could become bilateral negotiations are those in which ukraine gives up everything it gained a portion of its soveriegnty and forced to pay 700 billion or more in combined damages is a proof of the ability of active measures to control narratives ukraine would make those concessions at the minimum as they may make even more including in financial costs meanwhile the us is for some bizarre reason offering to make 179 billion in concessions to russia in money it paid to fix damages russia caused and even enriching a selfidentified strategic interest and enemy russia meanwhile literally not making a single concession and is getting more than it is demanding

how powerful does the us and the world honestly assess russia is has russia really warranted this does russia truly project hard power sufficient enough to the point where it can invade its neighbor and use conventional military force in europe with the intention of creating a genocide that to their own estimates  and under the false assumption most ukrainians would support russia  would logically make it larger in scope than the holocaust only to turn around and force the us to make concessions on its behalf when imposing its security interests onto both the us and ukraine is this how weak the us is now when the us decides toforce russiato the table the us demand russia do nothing while america agrees to pay 179 billion for the damages russia caused and ukraine agrees to effectively give up its own sovereignty  20 of its territory and 700 billion in financial expense which only happened due to russias illegal actions international law is not fair but this nihilistic retreat from everything the united states sought to project itself as over the last 100 years is a shameful embarrasing strategic selfown russia has done nothing to warrant being allowed to force the us or ukraine to take this deal

in any negotiation ukraine and only ukraine can make decisions for ukraine the degree to which jd vance believes the us has the right to control the cultural values of its allies is directly a function of how critical the us is to the allies it supports  therefore the us must use its hard power to force russia to start from the basis i laid out a the beginning as being the starting point and ukraine can decide from that what is acceptable and the us can decide for itself what is the minimum it can demand from russia

he has been hit with the maximum fines on both his charges yet has evaded jail time and his fines fall just short of kicking him out of parliament or preventing him from running in the upcoming 2025 general elections 

most analysts doubt this will have any significant impact on the election itself in dramatically swaying voters but it could have reputational impacts

2025-02-18 02:35:23,javier milei is betting big on an argentine oil gusher,"in a dusty desert in northwest patagonia a hulking rig is busy drilling after plunging 3km underground its drill turns and chomps horizontally for the same distance again in neuqun the nearest city boffins crunch data from the rig and keep its drill trained on an oilrich sliver of shale just five metres thick nearly 40 of these machines dot vaca muerta dead cow a vast shale patch in argentina the formation stretches from the andes to the outskirts of neuqun where its dark layers peek through the sand

argentina holds the worlds fourthlargest reserves of shale oil and more shale gas than anywhere except china argentines started tapping vaca muerta around a decade ago production grew steadily then a few years ago it exploded in 2024 argentina exported more energy than it imported for the first time in 14 years

this year argentina is set to overtake colombia which produced nearly 800000 barrels per day bd last autumn as south americas thirdbiggest crudeoil producer only venezuela which produces nearly 1m bd and brazil which produces more than 3m bd will pump more javier milei argentinas libertarian president calls vaca muerta a panacea and wants the countrys energy exporters to thrive if they do they could fuel his efforts to turn around decades of economic decline

argentinas shale business faced steep odds drillers swoon over vaca muertas geology likening it to the united states richest formations but as vinicius moraes of wood mackenzie an energyadvisory firm explains argentina is a different beast oilprice controls export taxes and capital restrictions long made it hard to do business those policies along with ageing conventional wells caused oil production to wane during the 2000s then in 2012 the decision of cristina fernndez de kirchner then argentinas president to nationalise ypfan energy company owned by repsol a spanish firmspooked investors

still enough money made its way into argentina to foster a burgeoning shale business miguel galuccio who ran ypf from 2012 to 2016 persuaded foreign firmsincluding chevron an oil majorto invest in joint ventures that may partly be down to the specific characteristics of shale drilling as francisco monaldi of rice university points out shale production has low initial costscompared say with setting up a big offshore operationbut requires sustained investment to drill new wells and keep production growing nationalising a shale project makes little sense for a cashstrapped government its like expropriating a carmaking company says mr monaldi its great at first but the next day you have to work out how to keep making cars


for that reason riskconscious investors were willing to invest gradually over the past decade shaleoil production has risen from around 20000 bd to nearly 450000 bd gas production has soared too see chart ypf alongside local drillers like vista energy which mr galuccio now runs have driven more recent growth when we said vaca muerta could double production in five years people thought we were crazy says daniel dreizzen a former secretary for energy planning most analysts now reckon vaca muerta can produce more than 1m bd by 2030

the boom has transformed neuqun vaca muerta had been home to some conventional drilling since 1918 but by the mid2000s output was falling shale gave neuquns older oilmen a second shot and still draws new workers to the city each week gustavo medele the energy minister for neuqun province says that a truck driver can earn the equivalent of 3000 a month roughly double the average national monthly salary not everyone is happy some locals worry about the water used to break up compact shale formations a mural near the city centre showing a firespitting rig next to a river declares water is worth more than oil

such criticism understates shales rewards the boom could transform argentinas economy estimates suggest that the shale business could help create between a quarter and half a million jobs by the early 2030s widening the countrys trade surplus would replenish its meagre foreigncurrency reserves helping it pay its debts aleph energy a consultancy that mr dreizzen now runs reckons that hydrocarbon exports could bring more than 30bn into argentina every year from 2030 that would go a long way towards widening argentinas total trade surplus energy exports helped push it to 19bn in 2024 the highest figure in years

mr mileis reforms have already made business easier since last year companies are no longer obliged to reserve a certain level of supply for local refiners before they can export the government has also stopped intervening in the oil market allowing the price of oil sold locally to rise closer to that of brent crude the global benchmark shalemen long for the end of argentinas capital controls which would make it easier to import kit and attract more foreign investment but removing those is slower work

foreign cash will help with argentine exporters most pressing problem infrastructure last years energy surplus was achieved by delivering gas to chile running oil pipelines at full tilt and sending the remaining barrels out of vaca muerta by truck an extra oil pipeline due to open early this year will offer some more capacity to send exports to puerto rosales a city on the coast exporters are also ramping up gas supplies to brazil using old pipelines via bolivia but markets in neighbouring countries remain small compared with those in asia and europe

and so to really increase exports argentina is looking farther afield several projects are under way supported by tax breaks and other incentives that mr milei has carved out for big infrastructure investments ypf alongside other companies is building an oil pipeline to carry 550000 bd to punta colorada where a deepwater port will receive bigger tankers the firm also wants to ship liquefied natural gas lng to asia where demand for the fuel is expected to keep growing until at least the 2040s the cost of the necessary export facilities is immense at some 50bn but ypf which has signed a deal to develop them with shell a british major is determined horacio marn its boss has been touring asia in search of orders on january 21st three indian companies said they were interested in taking shipments

two things could derail argentinas progress warns mr dreizzen first the coming wave of oil and gas production in the united states may push prices down making lng projects in particular less profitable and leaving argentine producers with little room to compete second if the country ended up in another economic crisis foreign investors would panic that would make expanding the countrys export infrastructure an even harder task milking vaca muerta for all its worth will not be easy but it is already transforming the country",lbrtrl,neoliberal,1,12,https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2025/02/16/javier-milei-is-betting-big-on-an-argentine-oil-gusher

2025-02-17 20:08:00,under trump cia plots bigger role in drug cartel fight,"the central intelligence agency is poised to take a larger more aggressive role under president donald trump in the battle against mexicanbased drug cartels devising and evaluating plans to share more intelligence with regional governments train local counternarcotics units and possibly conduct other covert actions according to people familiar with the matter

the expanded focus on cartels which smuggle fentanyl and other narcotics into the united states represents a new and potentially risky priority for the spy agency which in recent years has made espionage against china counterterrorism operations in the middle east and africa and support for ukraine after russias 2022 invasion its main concerns

cia director john ratcliffe intends to shift agency resources to its counternarcotics mission and apply insights from its two decades of tracking infiltrating and disrupting terrorist networks to fighting the cartels said a person familiar with his plans who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the subjects sensitivity and because the approach isnt finalized yet

a cia spokesperson said in a statement that countering drug cartels in mexico and regionally is a priority for cia as a part of the trump administrations broader efforts to end the grave threat from narcotrafficking director ratcliffe is determined to put cias unique expertise to work against this multifaceted challenge

the emphasis will be on increased us support to antidrug forces within mexico and elsewhere in the hemisphere people familiar with the emerging plan said less clear is whether armed us personnel either from the militarys special operations forces or the cia could be tasked with taking direct action against cartel leaders on mexican soil which former intelligence and military officials warn would spark a ferocious backlash and harm usmexican relations including counternarcotics cooperation

it remains unclear what other programs in the cias classified budget may be cut to fund more work on narcotics and two former us officials said the tradeoff could mean pulling back on other priorities such as china ratcliffe though has said repeatedly that gathering intelligence on china is his no 1 priority and amid trumps wideranging reshaping of the federal government the cia chief has signaled he plans to trim the agencys workforce offering employees there a deferred resignation package it is unclear how many cia personnel will take the buyout",John3262005,neoliberal,49,95,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/17/trump-cia-mexico-cartels/

first deputy mayor maria torresspringer who effectively runs the government deputy mayor for health and human services anne williamsisom deputy mayor for operations meera joshi and deputy mayor for public safety chauncey parker all plan to step down four people with direct knowledge of the matter told politico they were granted anonymity to describe internal dynamics

the pending resignations follow a tense meeting between the deputy mayors and adams at the official mayoral residence of gracie mansion friday night politico first reported wnbc then reported resignations were pending and the daily news and new york times further reported their likelihood

the deputy mayors voiced worry that adams is essentially doing the bidding of president donald trump a republican who remains deeply unpopular in new york city trumps department of justice last week ordered federal corruption charges against adams dropped in a case that appeared to be tied to the mayors cooperation on deporting migrants from new york city

danielle sassoon a federal prosecutor in manhattan resigned over the matter saying it amounted to a quid pro quo  an allegation adams attorney alex spiro adamantly denied

there is no fundamental conflict of interest or geopolitical conflicts between china and the eu wang said during his meeting with kallas on saturday adding that beijing supports all endeavors conducive to peace and backs europe in playing a significant role in the peace negotiation process regarding the war in ukraine

the eu response was somewhat more reserved with kallas saying the eu was ready to continue with dialogue and cooperate in selected areas such as trade economic affairs and climate change he urged beijing to halt exports of dualuse goods to russia which she said fuels moscows ongoing war against ukraine

wangs remarks were in stark contrast to us vice president jd vances criticism of european countries instead of highlighting the threats posed by russia and china vance accused european government of censoring rightwing parties and failing to control migration

analysts say chinas effort to strengthen engagement with europe is part of beijings plan to take advantage of divisions between washington and its european allies in recent weeks european commission president ursula von der leyen who has pushed the eu to adopt more assertive policies against china has repeatedly said the bloc is open to improving relations with china

zelenskyys arrival in the region at the same time as the us and russia are poised to meet for peace talks in saudi arabia has generated wide speculation about whether ukraine would participate us officials told politico at the munich security conference this weekend that washington had invited ukraine to take part a statement that was news to kyiv

ukraine will not take part in the negotiations ukraine did not know they were planned and the visit to the region was planned long before the us decided to meet russia there zelenskyy said adding that any peace talks held without kyiv at the negotiating table will bring no result

on monday ukraine and the uae signed an economic cooperation partnership opening free trade zelenskyy said he added that he will be traveling to turkey on tuesday when russia and the us are expected to meet in riyadh and only arrive in saudi arabia the following day

2025-02-17 12:06:46,republicans hope to jam through defense border funding boost ahead of shutdown fight,"senate republicans have the ambitious goal of jamming through funding boosts for defense and border security  separately from the appropriations process  ahead of a midmarch deadline to prevent a government shutdown

senate budget committee chair lindsey graham rsc said this week that he told president trump it would be really helpful if we could give him the money for the border plan for four years before march 14 

the strategy could help gop lawmakers secure more leverage in funding talks as republicans have sought lower levels for nondefense programs while democrats have demanded parity in increases to both defense and nondefense spending but republicans face enormous hurdles in moving such a plan out of congress despite controlling both chambers as gop leaders clash over how to advance key parts of trumps tax defense and border agenda

republicans would move the border and defense money through a process known as reconciliation which would allow them to bypass the 60vote threshold normally needed to move bills in the senate but reconciliation is a lengthy and complicated process normally taking far longer than the month remaining until march 14 and the chambers are already at odds over the first step

house and senate republicans last week advanced two separate budget resolutions which unlock the reconciliation process and outline requirements for the final bill

adding to the pressure on republicans lawmakers are beginning to acknowledge a stopgap funding measure of some kind will likely be needed to prevent a shutdown next month even as the trump administration is clamoring for more money for border security",John3262005,neoliberal,2,21,https://thehill.com/business/budget/5146835-senate-republicans-border-defense-funding/

trump speaking to reporters after a quick trip to daytona beach for the daytona 500 car race said the us was sticking to its plans to start implementing reciprocal tariffs thats alright i dont mind let them do it let them do it its just hurting themselves if they do that he said

the financial times reported earlier on sunday that the european commission would agree next week to explore tough import limits on certain foods made to different standards in an effort to protect its farmers echoing trumps reciprocal trade policy

early targets could include us crops such as soybeans grown using pesticides that eu farmers are not allowed to use the report said citing three officials it did not name

lets discuss what a democratic presidents agenda should look like in 2029 under three different political landscapes

scenario 1 democrats have a strong midterm showing expand their house majority and win the presidency by a decisive 46 margin the senate is narrowly in their control 5152 seats

scenario 2 democrats perform well in the midterms but lose some ground in 2028 they retain a slim house majority and hold the senate in a 5050 split the presidential race is closer with a 13 margin of victory

scenario 3 democrats struggle in the 2028 election holding onto the house by just a handful of seats while failing to reclaim the senate 49 seats the presidential victory is razorthin under 2

given these scenarios what should be the policy focus for a democratic administration lets assume any major electoral challenges from jd vance and others have been thwarted

netanyahu discussed the plan with us secretary of state marco rubio who kicked off a middle east visit by endorsing israels war aims in gaza saying hamas must be eradicated that created further doubt around the shaky ceasefire as talks on its second phase are yet to begin

rubio in his upcoming stops in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates is likely to face more pushback from arab leaders over trumps proposal which includes redeveloping gaza under us ownership netanyahu has said all emigration from gaza should be voluntary but rights groups and other critics say that the plan amounts to coercion given the territorys vast destruction

netanyahu said he and trump have a common strategy for gaza echoing trump he said the gates of hell would be open if hamas doesnt release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in the militant groups attack on southern israel on oct 7 2023 that triggered the 16month war

in an interview last week rubio indicated that trumps gaza proposal was in part aimed at pressuring arab states to make their own postwar plan that would be acceptable to israel rubio also appeared to suggest that arab countries send troops to combat hamas",John3262005,neoliberal,440,570,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-netanyahu-signals-hes-moving-ahead-with-trumps-plan-to-move-palestinians-from-gaza

2025-02-16 15:00:50,the us said ukraine would meet with russia to discuss peace that was news to kyiv,"ukrainian officials reacted with a mixture of shock and confusion to the news that top trump administration officials are traveling to saudi arabia to kickstart peace talks with russia in the coming days  and that ukrainians were also apparently coming 

i saw that someone said that there would be a meeting in saudi arabia i do not know what it is ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said on the sidelines of the munich security conference on saturday on the prospect of talks without ukraine at the table he said well this is not a serious conversation it seems to me

one ukrainian official at the conference expressed exasperation at the news saying i dont know where this came from or what they expect to be the outcome of these talks where we are not invited and back in kyiv mykhailo podolyak a top zelenskyy adviser was even more blunt there is nothing on the negotiating table that would be worth discussing he said russia is not ready for negotiations 

the ukrainians interviewed by politico were left confused not only about what was happening but who was in charge

vice president jd vance made no mention of the peace talks in his munich speech rubio made no public remarks at the conference and trumps special envoy for peace talks keith kellogg provided few answers about where the administration was headed in a closeddoor lunch session kellogg is not scheduled to attend the talks

the kingdom is concerned that iran may be more inclined to pursue a nuclear weapon now that its regional proxies  long viewed as a deterrent against israeli attacks  have been significantly weakened saudi arabia hopes to leverage its close ties with president donald trump to provide iran with a diplomatic bridge to the white house

while trump has said he wants to enter talks for a new deal the message from iran has been mixed with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei saying last week that talks with the united states were not smart

saudi arabia publicly welcomed the 2015 nuclear agreement between iran and world powers but privately seethed over the obama administrations failure to address its concerns about tehrans regional activities  particularly its missile program and proxy groups from yemen to iraq and lebanon which riyadh viewed as a threat to regional stability it later welcomed trumps 2018 withdrawal from the deal

but tensions between saudi arabia and iran have eased significantly since then in march 2023 the two countries made a surprise announcement to normalize relations in a chinabrokered agreement saudi officials view the deal as a major success believing riyadh has reaped its benefits  houthi attacks on saudi territory have ceased and the kingdom was spared in last years titfortat strikes between israel and iran despite fears that tehran might hit gulf arab oil installations if its own facilities were hit by israel

over the past 15 months israel has significantly weakened iranallied groups in lebanon and gaza and has struck targets in syria iraq and as far as yemen combined with the fall of the assad regime in syria these developments have dealt a serious blow to irans ability to project power beyond its borders",John3262005,neoliberal,6,27,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/middleeast/saudi-arabia-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-intl/index.html

usdas national animal health laboratory network program office has a staff of only 14 people but it plays a major role in responding to animal disease outbreaks its responsible for data management ensuring that labs across the country are conducting the same tests and following similar protocols to accurately and effectively track animal diseases

the labs that make up the american association of veterinary laboratory diagnosticians were informed that testing and other responses to the h5n1 outbreak would be slower after the layoff said keith poulsen director of the wisconsin veterinary diagnostic laboratory

usda did not immediately respond to a request for comment the departments work responding to diseases like african swine fever and foot and mouth disease could also be affected

usdas animal and plant health inspection service announced a third spillover event  the term for when a new strain of the virus infects another species  in dairy cattle in arizona another indicator that the nation has not yet contained the h5n1 virus

reps david valadao rcalif and nicole malliotakis rny  both of whom represent districts with a significant percentage of medicaid recipients  told the hill that they are withholding support from the budget resolution as they seek more information on the severity of the cuts and how they could impact their constituents and they are not alone

those worries are sure to raise alarm bells for speaker mike johnson rla and his leadership team  including budget committee chair jodey arrington rtexas  who are looking to push the resolution through the chamber and kickstart the process to pass president trumps domestic policy agenda as early as the week of feb 24 when the house returns

republicans can only afford to lose one vote if all members are present and the entire democratic caucus opposes the measure which is expected at the current moment key lawmakers say the resolution could be doomed to fail

while the worries appear to be more pronounced among moderates some conservatives have also raised concerns about the trajectory of the reconciliation process one house republican who is on the whip team told the hill that two conservatives reported friday that they were undecided on the measure

it is not however all bad news for johnson and gop leadership rep nick lalota rny who represents a purple district on long island told the hill on friday that he will support the budget resolution calling it an easy vote while signaling that the hard part will come when lawmakers have to craft the measure",John3262005,neoliberal,50,187,https://thehill.com/homenews/5146860-gop-budget-resolution-moderates-medicaid/

2025-02-16 10:50:42,us presented ukraine with a document to access its minerals but offered almost nothing in return,"ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy says he directed his ministers not to sign off on a proposed agreement to give the united states access to ukraines rare earth minerals because the document was too focused on us interests

the proposal which was a key part of zelenskyys talks with us vice president jd vance on the sidelines of the munich security conference on friday did not offer any specific security guarantees in return according to one current and one former senior ukrainian official familiar with the talks zelenskyys decision not to sign a deal at least for now was described as shortsighted by a senior white house official

ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals that are used in the aerospace defense and nuclear industries the trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on china but zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for ukraine that would deter future russian aggression its a colonial agreement and zelenskyy cannot sign it the former senior official said

white house national security council spokesman brian hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer but said in a statement that president zelenskyy is being shortsighted about the excellent opportunity the trump administration has presented to ukraine

the us proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing russian aggression the official suggested the us did not have ready answers to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in ukraine involving people and infrastructure

any deal must be in accordance with ukrainian law and acceptable to the ukrainian people the senior ukrainian official said gen keith kellogg trumps special envoy for ukraine and russia all but cut europeans out of any ukrainerussia talks despite zelenskyys request ukraine is now preparing a counter proposal which will be delivered to the us in the near future the official said",John3262005,neoliberal,66,483,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-us-zelenskyy-agreement-trump-minerals-4d5eefcc44c9f17f330db98d81720b29

2025-02-15 20:26:26,justice department fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts amid major government cuts,"on friday 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice said matthew biggs president of the international federation of professional amp technical engineers which represents federal workers two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week

it was unclear if they would be replaced the us justice departments executive office for immigration review which runs the courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges did not immediately respond to a request for comment saturday

immigration courts are backlogged with more than 37 million cases according to syracuse universitys transactional records access clearinghouse and it takes years to decide asylum cases there is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff though the first trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly

the trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials including mary cheng the agencys acting director sirce owen the current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge has issued a slew of new instructions many reversing policies of the biden administration

last month the justice department halted financial support for nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit

the firings touch on two top trump priorities mass deportations and shrinking the size of the federal government on thursday it ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers probationary workers generally have less than a year on the job",John3262005,neoliberal,48,329,https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-court-judges-fired-firings-d35eed0f685739c4a19d4c8baf39113a

2025-02-15 17:14:24,exploring mitch mcconnell what if moment his failure to convict trump after j6,"it is a popular sentiment here that if he wanted to mcconnell couldve convicted trump and barred him from future office i wanted to look into a what if scenario where he aggressively pursued conviction  i am by no means a dc insider if there is something wrong please correct me despite trumps attempt to end the american experiment by overturning the will of the american people mcconnell allowed him to remain a force in republican politics saying all he did was not vote for the bill is underselling his complicity in protecting and abiding trumps escape from justice  mitch mcconnell did not put the senate in session  since the first order of business would have been the second trail of trump its also worth noting that mitch mcconnell was only senate leader for this vital period because the georgia senators of ossoff and warnock were not sworn in on january 3rd with the rest of the 117th congress but were only sworn in on january 20th  his refusal to immediately start the senate trial did two things first it let time pass as the moment passed political polarization can step in and battle lines can form as the horrors and shock of the insurrection grow farther political games start to creep in at the moment a vote to convict might have been justified with their constituents as images and the rare rebukes of trump by conservative media are still fresh but now right wing media free over whatever ills of trump they had has poisoned the idea of conviction the second is that it provides a legal justification for senators to hide behind or to legitimately be concerned with the legal justification is that trump is no longer in office and the senate has no jurisdiction over a private citizen 



in this scenario im giving gop senators some benefit of the doubt in saying that jurisdiction concerns are legitimate so they impeach him prior to him leaving office so those concern are eased 

new tally with justifications for senators changing votes 

our new starting point 

55 remember ga has two lame duck senators

57 this quickly goes back to the original number as mcconnell and his protege john thune change their vote its worth noting that among the nonconviction voter these two had the most clear anti trump statements 

 63 these senators listed the fact trump was a private citizen as the main reason why they didnt impeach and were also very critical of him often saying he did do impeachable offenses 1 if mcconnell is whipping votes he goes perfect with these senators since they are very sympathetic to his cause and dont need persuading i put a rating on how likely i think they would vote to impeach if pressed this is from looking at their statements post j6 and how close they are with senate leadership 

	john boozman 710

	shelly moore capito 910

	john hoeven 910

	jerry moran 910

rob portman 1010

dan sullivan 910



now we reach an impasse we need four more votes and there are tons of avenues towards these votes none of them easy avenues can be combined with others to effectively whip votes i think it should be noted that a lot of these guys probably thought trump was a political loser at the time and distancing themselves from him although hurtful to them personally was good for the national brand  they certainly dont want to be on the losing side of this vote voting against mcconnell here would mean you are gonna be stripped of committee assignments in favor of those who did vote in favor mcconnell is putting his political life on the line for this vote and crossing him would incur his full wrath with only four votes to go do you really wanna be the last onboard 



 path 1 2 votes pressure the lame ducks  kemp and mcconnell both put pressure on the now lame ducks senators leoffler and perdue  to vote for conviction positions in a future kemp admin can be floated or positions in the rnc kemp solidifies his position as the post trump standard bearer with trump out of the way might be a little risky for kemp if it leaks he helped but i think the maga base will mostly focus on mcconnell as for perdue and loeffler they can put out a statement that will earn them infinite praise from the press and any media job they want           we personally oppose the impeachmentconviction of president trump however the people of georgia have spoken they have picked two senators that have made clear to us they would convict trump if in office the people of georgia elected osoff and warnock to be their representatives and in this crucial time we feel no matter our personal feelings we should  vote as they would so that the people of georgia can say their current representatives speak for them  for the record i dont actually believe they would think that it would be political cover for why they voted that way 



 path 2  8 votes appeal to leadershipold friends mcconnell appeals to senate leadership with a mix of sticks and carrots he has personal relationships with a lot of these people so i think getting them to vote with them on this isnt out of the realm of possibility for the more craven rick scott being on the winning side matters more than anything so if he sees that two or three of his colleagues have already decided to convict they would also vote to convict  signifies they have been in leadership together 9 years or more
    todd young 710 
    joni ernst 610 
    john barrasso 710  
    mike lee 610 
    rick scott 510
    roy blunt 710 
    mike crapo 510 long time whip
    richard shelby 610 retiring also abstained from vote creating j6 committee 

  


 path 3 the persuadablesprofiles in courage people that are a mix of political opportunists looking to get trump out of the way people that can be bribed or manipulated those who want to be on the winning team and those who despite bending over to lick the boot of trump want to see him gone if it can cost them nothing personally
    thom tillis 
    marco rubio
    tim scott
    jim inhofe
    james lankford
    jim risch actually had his office trashed by the rioters
    tommy tuberville
    lindsey graham the only one on the list who actively supported trump after the insurrection but if conviction was likely he would flip in a heartbeat



out of all these paths mcconnel wouldve had to go  which isnt that hard given the circumstances i was also very conservative in how i tallied votes i took a lot of senators at their word that they thought charges did not meet the standard to conviction even when they were critical of trump  getting one vote would have made it easier to get another vote and so on after you get the four votes needed for conviction i  think 7075 votes wouldve been a possibility  if you have leadership ambitions or want to move up at all in the senate voting against this is career suicide  as for political retaliation this is a man who lost a seat in alabama during his first term in office the mitch machine vs whatever unpaid heritage foundation rejects trump scraps can find is hardly a battle without the rnc machine to back him i doubt maga candidates find the same success especially with their figurehead out of the picture

the official added that the us scheme might not work as it could fall afoul of  ukrainian law

so the ukrainian side passed their draft version to the us side and they are working on it while ukrainians are working on american proposals the official said

a person familiar with negotiations told politico the americans were not happy with the ukrainian proposals

2025-02-15 06:52:22,chinese cars are taking over the global south,"styling build quality and polish were frankly lacklustre the review in car and driver a respected motoring publication of a vehicle made by byd on display at the detroit motor show in 2009 was hardly encouraging for a car that its chinese manufacturer hoped to start exporting to america in a few years

since then the global automotive industry has been overhauled china has taken a decisive lead as the worlds biggest manufacturer of cars despite its unpromising start byd has surpassed tesla as the worlds largest maker of fully electric vehicles evs by volume and is far ahead when plugin hybrids are included the company has assisted in wresting chinas car market from oncedominant foreign competitors at the same time it and other chinese firms such as chery geely and saic have turned their country into the worlds top exporter of vehicles speeding ahead of germany and japan

chinas carmakers now aspire to overthrow volkswagen and toyota at the pinnacle of the global car industry says pedro pacheco of gartner a consultancy further expanding exports is central to that the number of cars shipped abroad from china reached 47m last year triple the amount three years earlier according to citigroup around a third of these came from multinational brands with factories in the country the surge is set to continuein 2030 the bank reckons sales abroad will hit 73m

that has led to much consternation among incumbent carmakers with particular attention paid to the growing number of chinese evs on european roads yet the bulk of chinas car exportsnearly threequarters last yearare powered by internalcombustion engines ices and most are aimed neither at western europe nor america but at the rest of the world

carcarrying vessels are departing chinas ports in ever greater numbers in part because the domestic market where 23m passenger vehicles were sold last year is neither as fastgrowing nor as profitable as in the past chinese consumers once opted mostly for foreign brands but these days domestic carmakers account for around threefifths of sales in the country as harald hendrikse of citigroup notes at home the chinese have won

victory has come at a price however creating a homegrown ev industry using subsidies and other government inducements has resulted in severe overcapacity chinese factories could perhaps turn out nearly 45m cars a year equivalent to around half of all global sales yet they operate at only 60 of that capacity according to bernstein a broker oversupply has led to a vicious price war seeking an alternative outlet chinese carmakers have turned abroad byd geely and great wall have said that margins are five to ten percentage points higher on sales overseas

as the incentive to export strengthens however the opportunities to do so are diminishing last year the eu imposed tariffs on chinesemade evs to combat what it regards as unfair subsidies chinese brands share of ev sales in europe grew from around 4 in 2021 to 10 in 2024 but may now climb to only 11 by 2030 according to schmidt automotive research a consultancy if that door is slightly ajar others are firmly shut tariffs of 100 imposed during joe bidens presidency in effect bar chinese evs from america a further levy of 10 on chinese goods recently imposed by donald trump will not have much additional impact fierce loyalty to domestic brands in japan and south korea and rocky diplomatic relations with india have kept chinese carmakers at bay in those countries
switching lanes

undeterred these firms have shifted their focus to countries in southeast asia the middle east latin america and even africa although each is relatively small taken together they account for 20m sales or more most are fastgrowing unlike rich countries or china and do not have a big domestic industry that would lobby for protection emissions and other regulations are also not as strict notes felipe munoz of jato another consultancy

opportunism has played a role in this a shortage of chips during the pandemic prompted western carmakers to concentrate on their priciest and most profitable vehicles in their biggest markets rather than cheaper models better suited to developing countries that left a gap for china to fill western sanctions helped too the biggest importer of chinese cars is russia when western carmakers pulled out after its invasion of ukraine the share of chinese brands surged from 9 in 2021 to 61 in 2023 according to rhodium group one more consultancy sales of ice vehicles made up most of these russia which has a car industry of its own is not thrilled in 2024 it introduced a hefty recycling fee on imported cars in essence a tariff to stall chinas advance

chinese carmakers are powering ahead elsewhere they now have 8 of the market in the middle east and africa 6 in south america and 4 in southeast asia according to bernstein up from almost nothing a few years ago the takeup rate of evs in these countries is lower than in rich ones and most of the cars chinese firms sell are ice models but having established themselves their longterm aim is to electrify these markets which legacy carmakers still regard as their ice fiefs
chart the economist

already evs are picking up speed in some unlikely places in latin america they now make up 6 of total sales having doubled in 2024 according to bloombergnef a research firm in brazil the worlds sixthlargest car market it is nearly 7 with nine out of ten evs coming from chinese brands in mexico evs have hit 8 and in thailand some 15 by comparison in america the share is 8 the surge is set to continue overall evs will account for more than threequarters of chinese car exports in 2030 up from about a quarter in 2023 according to citi

chinese carmakers will not only ship from home they want to establish footholds by building factories abroad to sidestep tariffs avoid shipping costs and keep close to customers byd is in the vanguard it is making vehicles in thailand and uzbekistan with plants in brazil hungary indonesia turkey and perhaps mexico to follow others including chery changan great wall and saic all have overseas factories in operation or under construction chinese firms are expected to manufacture 25m cars abroad by 2030 according to citi about half in europe and the rest in the developing world

some planned overseas factories may not materialise there are suggestions that chinas government will force firms to slow foreign investment to keep facilities at home busy as well as to protect chinese technology from prying eyes even so rhodium calculates that if chinas carmakers get to 80 of their planned production in south america by 2027 they could win up to 15 of the market with locally made vehicles alone

chinas carmakers are transforming into global enterprises by stealing business from incumbents in places they had taken for granted that means a growing headache for japanese and south korean firms in asia and the middle east as well as western carmakers such as vw general motors and stellantis whose largest shareholder exor is a partowner of the economists parent company in south america if chinese competition abroad causes legacy firms to concentrate on protected markets like america and europe competitive pressure will increase there too

building brands signing on dealers and setting up service networks in smaller markets even if it starts with ice cars will embed chinese firms in these places elsewhere it will be hard to distract car buyers from the allure of chinese vehicles indefinitely autoexpress a british motoring magazine praises the byd seal an electric saloon launched in europe in 2024 for its handsome aerodynamic body and big power calling it a very serious car how times have changed",lbrtrl,neoliberal,5,31,https://www.economist.com/business/2025/02/13/chinese-cars-are-taking-over-the-global-south

rather than pay for the minerals the ownership agreement would be a way for ukraine to reimburse the us for the billions of dollars in weapons and support its provided to kyiv since the war began in february 2022 two of the officials said

treasury secretary scott bessent presented the proposal for the us to own half of ukraines rare earth minerals to president volodymyr zelenskyy in a draft contract he brought to their meeting on wednesday in kyiv according to eight us officials briefed on the meeting

after that meeting bessent said the draft of a usukraine rare earth minerals agreement reflected the presidents goal but he did not provide details of what the administration had proposed

the varied messages follow a call between russian president vladimir putin and trump on wednesday about negotiating a deal on terms that sounded favorable to moscow and without looping ukraine in until afterward trump also floated allowing russia back into the g7 this week and defense secretary pete hegseth told nato members that kyiv would need to face concessions  including the loss of its prewar borders and longsought nato membership

hegseth on thursday dialed back his comments on the ukraine war emphasizing everything is on the table but trump reiterated that ukraine joining nato was not practical and it was unlikely the country would return to its pre2014 borders

vice president jd vance meanwhile struck a strident tone on russia the vice president said in an interview thursday with the wall street journal that the us has a wide array of options if putin refuses to negotiate in good faith such as economic tools of leverage and military tools of leverage but he did not mention ukraine or russia in a blistering speech in munich denouncing european governments

the break from the trump administrations line by wicker  an ally who was instrumental in securing hegseths senate confirmation  underscores a longrunning tension in the party while republicans and democrats have backed arming ukraine against russias invasion support has started to flag in the gop ranks trump and vance have opposed additional funding pushed by the biden administration and campaigned on negotiating a swift end to the war

the administrations comments brought much stronger responses from across europe german defense minister boris pistorius said trumps insistence that ukraine wont join nato was clumsy french president emmanuel macron called trumps leadership an electroshock and warned a peace that is a capitulation would be bad news for everyone democrats chided trump and his team for suggesting the us could potentially cut a deal without kyiv at the table other gop lawmakers came straight out in defense of trump",John3262005,neoliberal,4,25,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/14/republican-response-trump-ukraine-peace-talks-00204447

2025-02-15 02:46:03,sweeping safetynet cuts have gop centrists questioning johnsons budget,"on thursday as republican hardliners celebrated a concession they won from party leaders to force deeper spending cuts as part of the gops sweeping policy push centrists expressed deep alarm about the trajectory of the massive legislation that will include border security energy defense and tax provisions

the emerging fault lines are many gop members in hightax blue states are concerned that the plan doesnt leave enough room to expand the state and local tax deduction and senate republicans and some house hardliners arent ready to give up on a competing twobill plan

rep david valadao who represents a heavily democratic district in central california is also among the republicans from hightax blue states who worried the latest budget plan doesnt provide enough room to sufficiently expand the salt deduction with more than a dozen votes at stake

its also far from certain how the house gop plan will play in the senate which has a long history of heavily editing tax plans sent across the rotunda theres roughly 40 provisions that expire at the end of this year and trump has a slew of tax cuts he wants on top of that with lawmakers in both chambers prepared to do battle over their favorite perks

house energy and commerce chair brett guthrie rky whose committee is tasked with shouldering more than half of the proposed spending cuts has acknowledged that some changes to medicaid might not be able to pass the house that includes socalled percapita caps a major costsaver that would convert the program from an openended entitlement to a populationbased grant to states but conservatives say the white house has been open to some medicaid reforms and house gop leaders have been in close contact with administration officials

gop leaders decision to include a 4 trillion debt ceiling hike in the budget blueprint is adding a further complication lifting the federal borrowing limit is deeply controversial among republicans and several gop members including reps tim burchett of tennessee and thomas massie of kentucky have never voted to do so

a growing number of gop lawmakers are trying to intervene with the trump administration and are weighing legislation to circumvent the changes but with the department of government efficiency and the office of management and budget moving at a rapid clip and flouting federal law to carve up the government the lawmakers face monumental challenges in getting the white house to spare their constituents from the ax

the fight illustrates how efforts by doge and omb to slash the federal bureaucracy are poised to create conflicts with industries and interests that republican lawmakers hold dear the confrontation is also the latest test of capitol hills power in the second trump era and a new front for lawmakers who have a direct say over federal spending

the white house is standing behind the cuts and urging congress to codify them raising doubts about the extent to which republicans on the hill can soften the blow its an awkward position for gop lawmakers who have otherwise voiced support for doge

senate majority leader john thune rsd might call grahams budget package to the floor next week which would lead to a votearama  in which senators can offer amendments for some 50 hours to score political points

the 135 members of the twoyear program were informed that many would be hearing of their dismissals by late in the day but by late friday afternoon none had yet received a notice of their firing one of the sources said

it is believed there will be a small number of exceptions people who are in the public health service and military officers who had been on the cdc staff before entering the program those two groups make up only a quarter of the current roster of eis officers

the eis as it is known is the worlds premier training program for applied epidemiology many public health leaders at the cdc and elsewhere in the world are graduates of the eis which was established in 1951 by the cdcs thenchief epidemiologist alexander langmuir in part because of cold war era concerns about the threat of germ warfare

cms said the cut will allow the exchanges to focus on more effective strategies to improve outcomes and to reduce premiums for people who dont qualify for subsidies the health agency justified the cut by noting navigators enrolled only 06 percent of plan selections on the federal exchange during the open enrollment period  at a cost of 1061 per enrollment 

experts pointed to federal data showing that navigators were much more effective in enrolling people in medicaid and the childrens health insurance program chip last year as they likely have more ties to lowerincome communities they helped enroll about 290000 people in medicaid and the chip

navigators arent private insurance brokers they are paid through user fees not by private plans and dont recommend specific plans or policies to consumers the decrease in funding will save a total of 360 million through aug 26 2029 according to cms

2025-02-14 12:39:27,republicans put healthcare cuts front and center to advance agenda,"house republicans are putting cuts to medicaid at the top of their list of budget cuts to help pay for their wideranging agenda that spans tax cuts energy production and border security

republicans are eyeing changes to how much the federal government as opposed to states will contribute to medicaid expenditures an amount called the federal medical assistance percentage or fmap the house budget committee on thursday considered a plan that would instruct the energy and commerce committee  which has jurisdiction over medicaid  to find 880 billion in savings over the next 10 years

possible changes that republicans are floating include capping medicaid spending on a per capita basis at a potential savings of 900 billion per year rolling back the enhanced federal matching rate for aca expansion states to save 561 billion and lowering the 50 percent floor for the traditional medicaid population for a savings of up to 387 billion

the gops budget reconciliation bill is designed to move much of president trumps legislative agenda through special rules that sidestep a senate filibuster the bill could add trillions to deficits without offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts to pay for it

asked during an interview on cspan tuesday what a republican reenvisioning of us health insurance programs would look like rep ralph norman rsc a member of the freedom caucus responded reenvisioning is to block granting dollars to the states let them decide how it wants to be allocated and its getting illegals off any federal program including medicaid

republicans are also considering establishing work requirements for medicaid an expansion of the child tax credit failed to pass last year because it didnt include work requirements among other reasons certain groups of people in the republican proposal wouldnt have to work in order to get health coverage through medicaid including pregnant women primary caregivers people with disabilities and fulltime students",John3262005,neoliberal,132,208,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5144053-republicans-put-healthcare-cuts-front-and-center-to-advance-agenda/

2025-02-14 09:12:19,will donald trump wreck or reform the pentagon,"in the pentagon they must surely be on high alert on february 9th president donald trump declared that it would soon become the target for elon musks department of government efficiency doge accusing it of hundreds of billions of fraud and abuse mr trump will unleash his insurgents fresh from feeding foreign aid into the woodchipper their work could not be more important or more risky

that is because americas armed forces face a real problem not since the soviet union launched sputnik and built huge tank formations at the height of the cold war have americas military vulnerabilities been so glaring in the killing fields of ukraine america is being outinnovated by drone designers in the seas and skies off china it is losing its ability to deter a blockade or invasion of taiwan

the stakes are all the higher because the pentagon is a place where maga ideology meets reality mr trumps foreign policy is transactional this week he said he had begun talks with russia on the future of ukraine but it is built on the idea that peace comes through strength and that is possible only if americas forces pose a credible threat and what if doge goes rogue in the pentagon if mr musk causes chaos or corrupts procurement the consequences for americas security could be catastrophic

the problems are clearest in the struggle to turn technology into a military advantage the drones over ukraine are upgraded every few weeks a pace that is beyond the pentagons budgeting process which takes years american and european jammers in electronic warfare cost two or three times as much as ukrainian ones but are obsolete many big american drones have been useless in ukraine newer ones are pricier than ukrainian models

another problem is that americas defence industry has been captured at the end of the cold war the country had 51 prime contractors and only 6 of defence spending went to firms that specialised in defence today just five primes soak up 86 of the pentagons cash wary of driving more primes out of business the department has opted for a riskaverse culture contracts are typically costplus rewarding lateness and overspending the resulting lack of productivity gains helps explain why building warships in america costs so much more than it does in japan or south korea

behind this is the nightmare of budgets twoyear delays are aggravated by congressional squabbling porkbarrelling politicians waste money by vetoing the end of programmes they guard their control over spending so jealously that without congressional permission the pentagon cannot as a rule shift more than 15m from one line to anothertoo little to buy even four patriot missiles when the pentagon proposed diverting just 05 of the defence budget to buy thousands of drones under its replicator initiative in august 2023 winning approval took almost 40 congressional meetings

pentagon angst is as old as the militaryindustrial complex past secretaries of defence including bob gates and the late ash carter were philosopher kings next to their new and manifestly unqualified successor pete hegseth and yet the defence bureaucracy has always seemed to come out on top

there are two reasons why this moment may be different one is that the time is ripe not only is the threat to american security becoming clear but a new generation of miltech firms including anduril palantir and shield ai is banging on the pentagons doors indeed palantir is now worth more than any of the five prime contractors

more controversially mr musk is eager to crack heads together an enthusiasm which stems partly from the second reason to hope his experience elsewhere in the 2010s to escape the ignominy of paying for rides to the international space station on russian spacecraft nasa put fixedprice contracts to provide such services out to tender boeing offered something called starliner mr musks spacex offered crew dragon at a much lower cost crew dragon has been a huge success starliner has yet to fly a successful mission and has left boeing having to absorb billions of dollars of budget overruns

from 1960 to 2010 the cost of getting a kilogram into orbit hovered at around 12000 spacex rockets have already cut that by a factor of ten and promise much more helsing europes only defence unicorn takes a similarly nimble approach to development continually updating its systems with data from the front lines

mr musks task is big and complex american weapons need more ai autonomy and lower costs where possible they should be made from cheap offtheshelf parts that ride on advances in consumer tech the pentagon should foster competition and risktaking knowing that some schemes will fail a decade ago carter set up a unit for innovation but it was often seen as a threat the pentagon needs more of them it should also listen to combatant commanders too often drowned out by politics hardest of all mr trump will have to get congressional republicans to give the pentagon a freer rein to spend and innovate

reforming the pentagon is much harder than other parts of government america cannot focus on preparing for war in 2035 if that involves lowering its defences today it cannot simply replace multibilliondollar submarines and bomber squadrons with swarms of drones because to project power to the other side of the world will continue to require big platforms instead america needs a department of defence that can revolutionise the economics of massive systems and accelerate the spread of novel systems at the same time

mr musk and his boss are conflicted if mr trump prefers sacking generals for supposedly being woke or disloyal he will bring dysfunction upon the pentagon if mr musk and his miltech brethren use doges campaign to wreck or to boost their own power and wealth they will corrupt it those temptations make it hard to think that this administration will succeed where others have failed but the hope is that they will americas security depends upon it",lbrtrl,neoliberal,4,3,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2025/02/13/will-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-wreck-or-reform-the-pentagon

2025-02-14 04:46:23,house republicans advance their budget after appeasing hardliners,"the house budget committee voted to approve a budget resolution along party lines 2116 after a marathon markup in order to rally enough republican support to push the measure over the finish line gop leaders placated fiscal conservatives by tweaking the blueprint that will ultimately allow them to pass a massive bill tackling tax cuts border security defense spending and energy policy  all while sidestepping the senate filibuster

the changes to the budget resolution if adopted by both chambers would force republicans to cut more spending in exchange for tax cuts it could curtail their ability to deliver on trumps most prominent campaigntrail promises like nixing taxes on tips while also alienating swingdistrict republicans uncomfortable with slashing safety net programs like snap food assistance to lowincome households

a floor vote on the fiscal blueprint is house gop leaders next challenge in the arduous process of unlocking the filibusterskirting power of reconciliation the budget measure would allow the houses tax panel to come up with tax cuts that increase the deficit by up to 45 trillion over a decade while ordering other committees to cut enough from mandatory spending programs to reduce the deficit by 15 trillion

so on thursday democrats on the budget committee spent more than seven hours peppering their gop colleagues with amendments that would nix the committee orders included in the fiscal blueprint they also branded the gop plan the republican ripoff and noted that it allows for a 33 trillion increase in the deficit over a decade

the panel defeated all 32 amendments democrats offered including several proposals aimed at stopping elon musk and his department of government efficiency from slashing federal funding and accessing federal systems that contain sensitive information about americans democrats also proposed amendments aimed at protecting funding for inkind food assistance programs meals on wheels and other initiatives funded through block grants to states for social services

of the two republican amendments offered thursday both were adopted one the compromise that won the house freedom caucus endorsement of the resolution would shrink the amount of tax cuts republicans can enact if they dont cut 2 trillion in spending at the same time the other would ensure republicans include the text of the reins act in their final reconciliation bill that measure a perennial favorite of congressional republicans would curtail federal rulemaking across government",John3262005,neoliberal,11,39,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/13/house-republicans-approve-budget-00204230

it adds to a series of court orders across the country in recent days temporarily blocking trumps actions ranging from orders restricting birthright citizenship to transferring incarcerated transgender women to male facilities to trumps firing of the head of a whistleblower office

under hursons new ruling various federal agencies are temporarily prohibited from withholding or conditioning funding based on a health care facility providing genderaffirming care anywhere in the country

the plaintiffs  a group of transgender teens their parents and two organizations pflag and glma  raised alarm that hospitals across the country quickly moved to cancel appointments after trump issued two executive orders as part of what his administration has called a crackdown on gender ideology

the justice department contested the plaintiffs arguments also insisting that the case was premature and should wait for additional guidance the judge rejected those arguments going as far as to call the governments position disingenuous at one point",John3262005,neoliberal,50,326,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5143847-trump-gender-affirming-care-executive-order-blocked/

2025-02-13 17:13:15,state says 400 million armored ev contract on hold,"the state department is placing a 400 million contract to build armored electric vehicles on hold a spokesperson told the hill on thursday

tech billionaire elon musks tesla appears to have been a likely recipient of the contract which originated from the biden administration the agencys procurement forecast for the year shows the planned contract for armored teslas with an anticipated award date of sept 30 

however the state department spokesperson said the solicitation for the contract is on hold and there are no current plans to issue it 

the biden administration had asked the agency to explore interest from private companies to produce armored electric vehicles according to the spokesperson the department opened up a public request for information to gauge interest and heard from only company they noted

the request for information which is now marked as inactive on the general services administration website where it was posted sought information on contractors capability to produce high quality and armored electric vehicles

2025-02-13 17:01:03,hardliners leadership strike deal on budget resolution ahead of key vote,"hardline conservatives and house gop leadership struck an agreement on the conferences budget resolution shortly before a key vote on thursday putting the measure on a path to advance out of committee if it holds

according to house freedom caucus chair andy harris rmd the agreement  which still has to be approved by the house budget committee  would allow rep jodey arrington rtexas the chair of the budget committee to adjust the dials and increase the cap on the deficit impact of the tax portion of the package of trumps priorities if additional spending cuts are made in other areas it would also give teeth to a 2 trillion deficit reduction target outlined in the bill that was key for fiscal hawks

arrington released a budget resolution on wednesday that outlines a 15 trillion floor for spending cuts across committees with a target of 2 trillion a 45 trillion cap on the deficit impact of the republicans plan to extend president trumps 2017 tax cuts and 300 billion in additional spending for the border and defense

under the agreement which will be brought up in the form of a managers amendment arrington would be able to adjust the spending cuts floor and tax impact cap when crafting the budget reconciliation package harris said the traditional mechanism of a reserve fund will enable those changes to allow the chairman to adjust the dials

for example with the deficit reduction floor set at 15 trillion and a target of 2 trillion if committees find 25 trillion in reductions arrington can allow ways and means to design policies that raise its deficit increase allowance from 45 trillion to 5 trillion  enabling the committee more flexibility to address trumps demands for tax cuts

importantly harris said the amendment would also require the budget chairman to lower deficit increase allowances for the tax portion if that 2 trillion target is not reached meaning the allowance for tax cuts and other priorities would be curtailed",John3262005,neoliberal,0,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5143160-hardliners-gop-leadership-deal-budget-resolution/

in recent weeks the president has suggested a mineralsforaid deal with ukraine drawing pushback from russia hes repeatedly suggested the us will acquire greenland a mineralrich danish territory possibly by force and he has said canada could become the 51st state  which canadian prime minister justin trudeau said should be taken seriously noting trump was interested in canadian minerals

trump is the latest president to take on an old challenge china controls processing of critical minerals like cobalt lithium and nickel as well as rare earth elements needed to make military and energy equipment the us has moved to chip away at chinas dominance over supply chains but has trailed efforts like chinas belt and road initiative which has built out infrastructure in developing countries to access minerals

at the same time us companies have warned that chinas unfair market practices including flooding the market with cheap products have made it difficult if not impossible to compete

and trumps america first push isnt occurring in isolation its complicated by the complex and often fraught positions of his billionaire tech adviser elon musk who has myriad ties to china through his position as ceo of tesla tesla for example has in recent months fought efforts to impose higher tariffs on chinese graphite a key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries

the 5248 confirmation vote brings to a close a contentious threemonth confirmation fight that served as a significant test of the republican partys loyalty to president trump

only sen mitch mcconnell rky cast a gop vote against kennedys confirmation after previously bucking his party on trumps defense secretary and national intelligence director

the final vote was essentially a formality after the senate finance committee last week sent kennedys nomination to the floor on a partyline vote  the full chamber on wednesday voted 53 to 47 along party lines to end debate and advance the nomination

four republicans would have needed to break with their party and vote with every republican for kennedys nomination to fail instead only one did  sens susan collins rmaine and lisa murkowski ralaska who have stood up to trump previously and opposed pete hegseths nomination to lead the pentagon this week said they would support kennedy despite their lingering concerns over his stance on vaccines",John3262005,neoliberal,291,851,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5141880-robert-f-kennedy-jr-confirmed/

2025-02-13 00:47:08,gop hardliners threaten revolt over johnson plan to implement trump agenda  cnn politics,"speaker mike johnsons budget plan is in trouble as multiple gop hardliners seek lastminute changes that could risk support from the partys centrist middle  jeopardizing leaderships plans to kickstart president donald trumps agenda in congress

just hours after the house gops compromise plan was released fiscal hawks in the chamber lined up to call for steeper cuts beyond the current reduction target of 15 trillion over a decade but the size of those cuts is already difficult for some gop centrists to swallow with republicans including rep don bacon of nebraska still unwilling to say whether they support cuts of that size

rep ralph norman a south carolina republican who sits on the house budget committee that will vote on the measure thursday declined to say if he would support it and said he wants to guarantee that the final bill will include policy such as work requirements for medicaid as well as an antired tape bill called the reins act three other members of that panel  rep chip roy of texas tom mcclintock of california and andrew clyde of georgia  would not answer when asked how theyd vote on thursday a fourth member rep ben cline of virginia said he is a lean yes

some signaled that conservatives could make changes to the measure during thursdays markup though they declined to offer details rep scott perry a pennsylvania republican and member of the house freedom caucus who does not sit on the budget panel suggested that changes could come during the makeup on thursday though he wouldnt offer more details

the backlash from gop hardliners is sharp despite weeks of behindthescenes negotiations between johnson his leadership team and the right flank of the conference rep eric burlison of missouri called the spending cuts target pathetic and said he believes there are at least a half dozen republicans who agree and would oppose the plan on the floor that number  given johnsons razorthin margins  is enough to tank the bill

the budget plan requires republicans to cut at least 15 trillion in mandatory spending with a goal of 2 trillion but many conservatives say they want to see a specific target of 2 trillion saying otherwise that extra halftrillion in cuts wont happen

achieving that level of cuts will likely require republicans to find savings in medicaid which has made some centristleaning republicans uneasy and some are frustrated that ultraconservatives demanded changes to the previous measure which speaker johnson had outlined to gop lawmakers earlier in the year",John3262005,neoliberal,63,275,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/gop-hardliners-revolt-mike-johnson/index.html

2025-02-12 20:19:26,how trumps assault on bureaucracy could rock virginia elections,"virginia democrats have a new message for the tens of thousands of federal workers who will vote in their state elections this fall republicans stood by silently as president donald trump came for your jobs

the states offyear races are often a bellwether for the national mood a year before the midterms but they are poised to take on even more significance this november because so many government employees and contractors who live in northern virginia are experiencing firsthand the impact of the trump administrations attempt to shrink the federal bureaucracy

trump has steamrolled through his first few weeks in office while democrats have struggled to muster the kind of resistance they put up during his first term but in recent days they have started to zero in on elon musk and his socalled department of government efficiency as a foil painting the tech mogul as an unelected south african billionaire wreaking chaos on everyday americans

at trumps behest musk has used doge as a beachhead to attack the consumer financial protection bureau usaid and the department of education doge has offered buyouts to thousands of federal workers and threatened layoffs to those who dont take it

and if musk and doge have given national democrats an opening to make an argument against republicans  musk himself is less popular than trump according to recent polling  the virginia elections may stand as a test case

virginia republicans argue that democrats failed to address voters economic anxieties when they had total control of the states government  and that they will punish them at the ballot box instead",John3262005,neoliberal,15,53,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/12/trump-democrats-virginia-bureacracy-00203845

2025-02-12 19:31:32,republicans love trumps spending cuts just not in their states,"republicans in congress have responded to president trumps unilateral moves to freeze federal spending dismantle programs and fire civil servants with a collective shrug staying mostly silent and even praising him as he circumvents the legislative branch

but in recent days as his slashandburn campaign to remake the government has begun to affect their states and districts some republicans have tried to push back in subtle ways they have sought carve outs and special consideration for agriculture programs scientific research and more even as they cheered on mr trumps overall approach

their swift and quiet moves to protect their own pieces of the federal spending pie without critiquing mr trump are an early indication of the political realities that could pose obstacles to the presidents push many programs he has targeted for costcutting have entrenched constituencies in congress built up by republicans over many years it is one reason that shrinking the size of the federal government will be a mammoth task despite the gops posture of maximum deference to mr trump

ms britt was one of the first republicans to raise concerns at home soon after the trump administration directed the national institutes of health to slash 4 billion in overhead costs for medical research grantees a move that has since been paused by a federal judge ms britt whose state has received more than 518 million in nih grants for projects currently active there told a local news outlet that she would press administration officials to take a smart targeted approach to cuts so as to not hinder lifesaving groundbreaking research at highachieving institutions such as the university of alabama at birmingham

in the house a group of republicans from farm states and districts introduced legislation this week that aims to salvage a foreign aid program targeted for extinction by mr trump as part of his effort to wipe out the us agency for international development

the bill would transfer oversight of the food for peace program which purchases crops at market price from american farmers and distributes them to hungry people abroad from usaid to the agriculture department the lawmakers argued that their legislation fulfills the spirit of what mr trump calls his mandate to slim down the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient

not all republicans are pushing back on mr trumps efforts to slash federal spending even when those cuts hit programs in their states",John3262005,neoliberal,84,613,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/us/politics/trump-spending-republicans-agriculture-research.html

2025-02-12 17:27:58,us sending nonviolent lowrisk migrants to guantanamo despite vow to detain the worst there,"while the trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals and suspected gang members to guantanamo bay it is also sending nonviolent lowrisk migrant detainees who lack serious criminal records or any at all according to two us officials and internal government documents

when he ordered officials to convert facilities inside the us naval base at guantanamo bay cuba into a largescale immigration detention site late last month president trump said it would house the worst migrants and provide additional detention space for highpriority criminal aliens 

administration officials have since touted military flights to guantanamo that they said have transported migrants in the us illegally who have also committed violent crimes like murder and rape as well as alleged members of tren de aragua the infamous gang that originated in venezuelan prisons

internal documents and interviews with us officials indicate the administration has sent migrant criminals and alleged gang members to guantanamo detaining them in the post911 maximumsecurity prison that also houses in a separate section more than a dozen terrorism suspects

but in addition to sending those with criminal records or suspected or known gang ties  classified as highrisk detainees  us officials have also transported migrants deemed to be lowrisk to guantanamo according to the government documents obtained by cbs news more lowrisk migrants are expected to be transported on wednesday alongside highrisk detainees the documents show

federal immigration authorities define lowrisk detainees as migrants who face deportation because they are in the us illegally but who have not been arrested or convicted of violent offenses or other serious crimes government guidelines show us officials said they could include migrants who lack any criminal record but have been ordered deported because of civil immigration violations like entering the country without proper documents",John3262005,neoliberal,60,382,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-bay-migrants-trump/

2025-02-12 16:25:56,the presidents favorite decision the influence of trump v us in trump 20,"jack goldsmith of harvard law aei amp lawfare writes that the importance of trump vs us is not the immunity decision but the expansion of executive power 

he writes that the administrations behavior signals that it believes in a maximalist view of the unitary executive and that it plans to cite the case in upcoming battles 

gtlast fall i argued that the decisions main significance for the presidency lies not in its holding about presidential immunity but rather in its expansive discussion of exclusive presidential powers independent of the immunity ruling

beyond summarizing the case amp specific examples of enhanced power removal power over law enforcement goldsmith notes how the administration has sought to push back against limits like the impoundment act to outline what seems to be their operating theory 

not only is the president a branch of govt per trump vs us but that all aspects of the executive are entirely part of the legal body of the president 

he quotes adrian vermule 

gtgtthere is no such thing as executive power given to subordinate officers or administrative agencies in their own right there is only ever the executive power of the president which alone incarnates and gives legal life to the legal authority of all his subordinates

 at the conclusion goldsmith mentions that this goes beyond pam bondis insistence that the ag is the presidents lawyer but that

gt as vermeule says the views that all congressional delegations of power to executive branch officials including adjudicatory power are in reality delegations to the president and that subordinate officers enjoy the presidents own immunity from civil and criminal process

but three weeks into his term mr trump and white house officials have become more measured in how they discuss their efforts to tame inflation they have begun downplaying the likelihood that consumer costs like groceries will decline anytime soon reflecting the limited power that presidents have to control prices those are largely determined by global economic forces

the shifting tone could allow mr trump to reset expectations about how fast prices will come down as he pursues policies like tariffs and tax cuts which economists say could exacerbate inflation

mr trump and his advisers believe that expanding american energy production and rolling back regulations will reduce costs they also argue that some of mr trumps tax proposals such as eliminating taxes on overtime would curb inflation by giving workers more incentives to work longer hours therefore expanding the labor force

at a news briefing last week karoline leavitt the white house press secretary said mr trump was doing everything possible to alleviate the nations costofliving crisis but when asked at what point americans would begin to experience relief from high consumer prices she said i dont have a timeline

2025-02-12 12:13:47,republicans weigh ending wall streets favorite tax break,"republicans are considering doing away with one of wall streets favorite tax breaks at the encouragement of president trump one that has long enjoyed republican support and that could put up yet another obstacle on the road to a tax bill

the tax break on carried interest  often called the carried interest loophole  allows the managers of investment funds such as private equity firms and hedge funds to count their income as capital gains and thereby have it be subject to a lower tax rate

the tax rule which has been debated by lawmakers for more than a decade and has come within a hairs breadth of getting canceled in previous legislative fights would affect compensation levels at some of wall streets most powerful firms

republicans say that canceling the tax break would improve the public perception of their tax law which includes many tax breaks for business owners and other taxpayers at the top end of the income spectrum

however ending the tax break could make extending the trump tax cuts seem more egalitarian republicans said according to one distributional analysis of the extensions by the institute on taxation and economic policy itep the richest 1 percent would receive an average tax cut of around 36300 while nearly all other income segments would actually see a tax increase 

amid such a skew republicans are seeing the appeal of targeting a wall streetfocused tax break though they say the discussion is still in early stages",John3262005,neoliberal,25,106,https://thehill.com/business/5138964-carried-interest-tax-break-republicans/

russell hott and peter berg who held top positions in the enforcement division of ice will return respectively to the agencys washington field office and to st paul minnesota

todd lyons who previously ran the agencys boston office will take over as acting head of ice enforcement and removal operations the people said the changes were first reported by the washington post

the shakeup at ice comes as the president and his top immigration officials are increasingly frustrated with the current pace of arrests and deportations  as well as the release of some migrants due to lack of detention capacity ice has increased arrests in recent weeks but the trump administration continues to face a slew of challenges as it tries to move quickly to fulfill the presidents mass deportations promise an ambitious undertaking that will take funding time and resources to scale up

the administration has blitzed the airwaves and social media feeds with announcements of enforcement actions by ice and white house social media accounts have highlighted photos of shackled migrants being loaded onto military aircraft and mugshots of arrested migrants during the last week in january ice averaged more than 800 arrests a day according to data posted on x but over the last week the agency has stopped publishing daily arrest figures",John3262005,neoliberal,6,39,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/ice-officials-removed-pressure-increase-deportations-00203747

those same employees had actually first received emails on friday evening informing them they were being let go according to two people familiar with the situation supervisors the people said had not been notified and scrambled to get clarity about the situation

it wasnt until monday afternoon that sba officials clarified that the termination notices were a mistake in an email those whod received the unsigned draft letter were informed that it was sent in error  and not currently in effect that explanation was hardly reassuring for sba employees who remained in limbo

on tuesday shortly after trump signed the executive order giving musks doge outfit even more authority and reach than it already had the same people got the email again this time it was real and whereas the draft they received on friday specified that their terminations would take effect on feb 21 the new email stated that their jobs were being ended immediately

2025-02-12 02:01:49,bird flu is spreading in cattle but some states still arent part of us milk testing,"three of americas top milkproducing states arent a part of federal surveillance testing for bird flu even as a new variant is turning up in dairy cattle in what some public health experts say is a troubling gap in the national effort to identify and detect the spread of the virus 

the us agriculture department started a voluntary milktesting program in december after the virus was found to have jumped to cattle in march the recent outbreak of avian influenza in the united states was first detected in 2022 but has picked up steam over the last year decimating poultry farms nationwide killing tens of millions of birds and driving up the price of eggs 

while the risk to humans remains low many public and animal health experts argue that broad nationwide testing of milk is critical to containing virus cases that might otherwise go undetected giving the variants more opportunities to spread to animals  and to humans

texas wisconsin and idaho three of the countrys top five milkproducing states arent participating in the voluntary federal testing program and though efforts are underway to get them on board its not clear when they will join or how long it will take 

texas had the first known case of bird flu in cattle the first person believed to be infected by a mammal and a case in dairy cattle as recently as december but the states agriculture commissioner sid miller said surveillance milk testing was unnecessary since there are currently no active cases of bird flu in the states commercial cattle or poultry

wisconsin said it continues to work toward enrolling in the usdas testing program and is working closely with state and federal partners to monitor bird flu developments according to a spokesperson for the state agriculture department 

idaho did not respond to requests for comment but is not currently participating in the program according to the usda",John3262005,neoliberal,8,88,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/push-detect-virus-milk-supply-testing-bird-flu-cows-rcna188612

el salvadors foreign minister alexandra hill tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the us would help power the central american country at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices

rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that el salvadors president nayib bukele also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated americans from the us and put them in his jails  

bukele said he would charge the united states a relatively low fee to house convicted criminals in el salvadors terrorism confinement center or cecot a megaprison built to hold up to 40000 people he said the nominal cost for america would help make  el salvadors prison system sustainable 

the nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the united states according to edward kee who in 2022 was appointed to the department of energys nuclear energy advisory committee

2025-02-11 23:22:55,gop leaders downplay medicaid cuts as they seek 2t in savings,"house republican leaders on tuesday downplayed the possibility of cuts to medicaid benefits as they seek a reconciliation bill with up to 2 trillion in savings  

speaker mike johnson rla and majority leader steve scalise rla sought to reassure the public  and potential jittery members of their own caucus  that the medicaid changes under discussion include work requirements and fraud reduction not drastic cuts like lowering the federal match for medicaid expansion states or instituting a per capita cap 

house republicans are debating how deep they need to cut to pay for an extension of president trumps tax cuts and border enforcement funding and how much political backlash they can endure 

one of the prime targets is medicaid the joint federal and statefunded program that provides health coverage to more than 72 million lowincome americans republicans see medicaid as a program rife with fraud and abuse and have long sought to rein in its spending  

work requirements would save about 100 billion over a decade but hardline conservatives are pushing for a bottomline figure of at least 15 trillion to 2 trillion which could necessitate even more cuts 

the most controversial changes like lowering the federal match for the medicaid expansion population and instituting a per capita cap would save 561 billion and up to 900 billion over a decade respectively according to house gop estimates 

scalise on tuesday didnt rule out going further on medicaid cuts but he also suggested the primary focus was work requirements",John3262005,neoliberal,82,212,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5139533-house-republicans-medicaid-cuts/

2025-02-11 06:43:49,pakistan is furious with the afghan taliban,"it is a humbling admission for an old ally they dont listen to us general asim munir pakistans army chief complained about the afghan taliban last month in general munirs reckoning pakistan is not asking for much all the country needs from its brotherly neighbour is to stop the spread of terrorism in pakistan from across the border a helping hand as it were from the afghan taliban

instead the powerful unelected generals who run pakistan have mostly received a middle finger in december 16 pakistani soldiers were killed by the tehreeketaliban pakistan ttp the pakistani wing of the taliban in a border attack pakistans armed forces responded by bombing ttp hideouts in afghanistan that prompted the taliban to defend the ttp as guests and vow revenge that month the taliban attacked pakistani troops on the border

pakistans anger at its vexatious ally is well founded violence is up in 2024 there were 521 terrorist attacks in pakistan a 70 increase on the year before according to the pakistan institute for peace studies an islamabadbased thinktank this resulted in nearly 2000 casualties militant violence which had been in decline in pakistan since 2014 has increased every year since the taliban came to power in afghanistan following americas withdrawal of troops from the country in 2021

much of the violence last year with over 300 attacks can be attributed to the ttp pakistani officials estimate 10000 of its fighters now roam along the border between the two countries the ttp has narrowed its focus and its goals it mostly attacks military targets and is demanding a reversal of the merger in 2018 between khyber pakhtunkhwa a province of pakistan and britishera tribal areas

pakistan miscalculated in assuming the taliban would be a reliable and pliable ally once in power says andrew wilder at the united states institute of peace a thinktank pakistans lopsided relations among the afghan taliban factions have added to the problem pakistans army is close to the haqqani network with its strongholds in eastern afghanistan by contrast the ttp pledges allegiance to the talibans leader haibatullah akhundzada relations between him and pakistans generals are far cooler

wizened afghan hands have known the taliban to be stubborn allies since inception in the 1990s they gave sanctuary to pakistani sectarian militants who tormented the countrys shias they refused to hand over the leaders pakistan demanded but pakistans dysfunctional politics also complicates the relationship between the two countries the province of khyber pakhtunkhwa where there were 295 militant attacks last year is governed by the pakistan tehreekeinsaf the party founded by imran khan the jailed former prime minister its chief minister insists on negotiating unilaterally with the taliban incensing the federal government the army which opposes such talks wants mr khans provincial government to beef up its police resources to fight the ttp

the government is trying other negotiating tactics since september 2023 some 815000 afghans have been evicted from pakistan the united nations estimates another 3m fleeing afghanistans long wars remain trade between the two countries has nosedived even so the afghan taliban are unmoved they know pakistans armtwisting has its limits

last month the taliban hosted the iranian foreign minister in kabul a first since 2017 trade was on the agenda earlier in january indias foreign secretary met the talibans foreign minister in dubai to pakistans annoyance we ask them to start acting and behaving like a state and to understand their obligations a senior pakistani security official complains but nothing changes so much for that ally",lbrtrl,neoliberal,84,330,https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/02/06/pakistan-is-furious-with-the-afghan-taliban

the news comes amid an ongoing dispute over an effort to gather names of fbi employees who worked on jan 6 cases a federal judge signed off friday on an agreement that forbids the public release of the list of fbi employees who worked on the sprawling probe which grew to be the largest in fbi history with more than 1500 defendants",John3262005,neoliberal,5,24,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-administration-orders-list-new-fbi-recruits-deepening-fears-cuts-rcna191503
2025-02-11 03:36:19,venezuela sends 2 planes to us to return migrants signaling a potential improvement in relations,"two venezuelan planes flew to the united states on monday and returned home with deported venezuelans signaling a possible improvement in relations between longtime diplomatic adversaries and a victory for president donald trump in his efforts to get more countries to take their people back

the us and venezuelan governments separately confirmed the flights by venezuelan airline conviasa without saying how many were aboard or disclosing their routes

the venezuelan government confirmed the flights in a statement that took issue with an illintentioned and false narrative around the presence of members of the tren de aragua gang in the united states it said most venezuelan immigrants are decent hardworking people and that us officials sought to stigmatize the south american country

deportation flights from the us to venezuela were halted for years but restarted for a short time under the biden administration in october 2023 when a jet transported about 130 migrants home venezuelans began showing up at the us border with mexico in large numbers in 2021 and are currently one of the largest nationalities entering illegally

mondays flights came days after the first flights of immigrants to a us military base in guantanamo bay cuba and after us secretary of state marco rubio struck agreements with el salvador and guatemala for those countries to take people who were not their citizens

trump wrote after grennells visit that the maduro government had agreed to receive all venezuela illegal aliens who were encamped in the us including gang members of tren de aragua and pay for their transportation six americans held in venezuela were released at the time

in its statement monday the venezuelan government didnt comment on any future flights",John3262005,neoliberal,5,15,https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-crackdown-venezuela-aragua-a9b5a11b1e14e40c62741ac6f1aa0f74

2025-02-11 01:27:52,military drops recruiting efforts at prestigious black engineering awards event,"the army and other service branches are abandoning recruiting efforts at a prestigious black engineering event this week turning down access to a key pool of highly qualified potential applicants amid president donald trumps purge of diversity initiatives in the military

until this week army recruiting command had a longstanding public partnership with the black engineer of the year awards or beya an annual conference that draws students academics and professionals in science technology engineering and math also known as stem

the event which takes place in baltimore has historically been a key venue for the pentagon to recruit talent including awarding reserve officers training corps scholarships and pitching military service to rising engineers past beya events have included the army chief of staff and the defense secretary

the services cited concerns that participation in the predominantly black event could run afoul of trumps orders and the pentagons intensifying push to erase diversity efforts in the military according to multiple sources familiar with the decision defense secretary pete hegseth on jan 31 ordered that black history month womens history month and others were officially dead and that the military would no longer mark them

additional recruiting events tied to specific racial or gender groups are also likely to be scrapped two defense officials told militarycom that includes other conferences and career fairs with thousands of participants the decision to abandon the black engineering event marks a significant shift in military recruiting strategy  and sparked calls of discrimination

while the services are pulling out of beya a wellestablished pipeline for highcaliber stem talent they remain engaged with other events last week the same army recruiting unit that would have attended beya instead participated in a national rifle associationsponsored event in harrisburg pennsylvania a predominantly white gathering that recruiters acknowledge is less likely to yield highquality applicants",John3262005,neoliberal,29,146,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/10/military-drops-recruiting-efforts-prestigious-black-engineering-awards-event.html

2025-02-10 23:25:20,fbi must disclose more info about trump classified docs case judge rules,"the dismissal of criminal charges against donald trump for concealing classified records at maralago eliminated a significant barrier to making records about the probe public a federal judge ruled monday

us district judge beryl howell said trumps election as president  which forced the end of the criminal case  combined with the supreme courts ruling on presidential immunity mean trump is effectively insulated from any criminal responsibility for his conduct

that means the fbis previous reasons for refusing to gather and disclose records related to the probe no longer apply howell wrote in a ruling in a freedom of information act case brought by journalist jason leopold she noted that while the dismissal of charges against trump may have reduced his criminal exposure it ironically made him more susceptible to public scrutiny for his conduct

she ordered the fbi to comb its records for documents responsive to the foia request and confer with leopold about a timetable for release providing an update to the court by feb 20

howells ruling comes amid an effort by public interest groups and congressional democrats to access former special counsel jack smiths final report on trumps concealment of classified documents at maralago after his first term trump faced dozens of felony charges in the case until they were dismissed by us district judge aileen cannon who ruled last year that smiths appointment was unlawful

typically the fbi refuses to confirm or deny the existence of a criminal investigation a response meant to protect the secrecy of ongoing investigations and the privacy of people who may not ultimately be charged but howell said that rationale  known as a glomar response  no longer applies to documents contained in trumps maralago file",John3262005,neoliberal,11,114,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/fbi-trump-classified-docs-case-015570

2025-02-10 14:43:58,the official guide to the rneoliberal discussion thread,"introduction

as you all know rneoliberal recently became a market success when draco decided to leak controversial personal messages and then step down from his moderator position this was known as drexit and is easily searchable on the meta subs since then this subreddit has become more and more active with the primary hub of activity being the daily discussion thread the dt which is meant for the habitual visitor and is within certain limits respectable and understandable however this has started to change due to transitions in the moderator team causing them to become more fash this backfired in response the dt is now full of shitposts copypasta partisanship and inside jokes theyre not funny that may not be immediately clear i decided to write this guide on the dt so that no one from the community has a problem with integrating into the community many of you may remember i also wrote a guy last year there are almost no changes whatsoever except for the fact that im now a moderator so this thread can be branded as official instead of unofficial treat it as a moderator approved example of a copypasta if you wish 

basic characteristics

the dt is full of shitposters and undergrads so do not expect any serious information or constructive opinions an integral part of the dt are hot takes any take can be judged on a spectrum from cold to hot however the correctness of the take is also a major factor in judging its overall worth and contribution to the dt thus it is very important to internalize this chart the first quadrant q1 is the uppermost quadrant thus a take that is hot and good is q1 the quadrants are counted counterclockwise thus a q4 take is cold and good 

the dt tends to snowball which means that if someone writes anything and i mean anything someone may copypasta it if someone else makes a copypasta out of that then a torrent of copypastas will flood the dt until the fash mods ban the copypasta this is known as fash cooling as it cools down the dt

if you want to throw money out of the window while still helping the global poor you can donate 5 to charity in may if you donate enough money you can get some nice perks including custom flairs more details will be coming soon theres also a website or podcast or something that the mods have been allegedly working on but most dt regulars are confident that it doesnt exist 

basic customs

1 genuine discussion

genuine discussion is a becoming a dying breed these days typically it will take the form of someone asking a genuine question in good faith or linking a news articleopinion piece with thought provoking commentary

example 

cdstephens hey i had a question about some basic supply and demand stuff if the supplier of a good enacts perfect price discrimination does that just convert consumer surplus into producer surplus 

papermarioguy02 yep that sounds about right 

2 takes

as mentioned before takes are vital in the dt so much so that people will post naked takes without any provocation or context it is important that you label your takes calling it hot cold or something else indicating temperature 

example

cdstephens hot take donald trump is bad

agent78787 good job you just solved global warming

3 shitposts

a shitpost can take many forms even that of genuine discussion its hard to accurately describe the quality of a shitpost but youll know it when you see it

example

cdstephens if you have goose tacos you dont have a country 

futuresaurusrex ugustacho btfo


4  inside jokes

the dt has a plethora of inside jokes or phrases that are recognizable to the dt regulars but indecipherable to the average person below is a list of examples it is by no means comprehensive

 gtinsert funny quote here

 milton friedman
 
this but ironically
 
 this but unironically
 
 why do you hate the global poor
 
 fellas is it gay to play football youre literally touching another man 
 
 
 
 oonts
 
 wow infrastructure week really isnt going so well
 
 were all webby alts and gl0betrotter alts except for uerra0 whos a cdstephens alt
 
 let me r1 you real quick
 
 dae belgium isnt a country
 
 the dt is overrun with succdems
 
 the dt is overrun with soccons
 
 the dt is overrun with weebs
 
 purge the succsweebs
 
 wtf i love trump now

5 strawpolls

a classic thing to post in the dt is a strawpoll for a strawpoll to be considered valid it cant be an obvious question eg do you like obama more than trump and it must contain a jill stein option here is an example of an acceptable poll

6 schisms

a schism is when a controversial disagreement occurs in the dt contrary to popular belief its usually not a communitywide schism rather its typically 13 regulars arguing for a controversial opinion 

example 

cdstephens hot take bernie isnt that bad

everyone else wtf did you just say

7 live blogging

many dt regulars treat the dt as a liveblog this can be anything from talking about youre recent date to complaining about class to talking about your sex life try not to do this please 

example

uraniumkore someone in this history class just asked what the bolshevik revolution was and someone else responded with it was at the end of wwii

8 moduser exoduses

sometimes you get fed up with the dt other times it starts to encroach on your normal life maybe you dont like the direction of the subreddit and think its getting too leftrightweeb it might reach the point where you stop posting in the dt altogether you cant however just leave as people are familiar with who you are as a person many regulars will announce or tease their leave and then delete their account altogether 

example

functionalaesthetics heres a list of copypastas that i really like also im leaving cause of this long list of reasons k thanks

9 flairs

flairs comprise of a picture of something and a text there are a list of default flairs where the accompanying text will be the flair label however there are a variety of special flairs that people can get under certain circumstances including the upcoming charity drive 

example

cdstephens  richard feynman  who let this shitlord into grad school

10 copypasta

last but not least is copypasta a specific type of shitpost a copypsata is where you take a comment and change the words around to become allegedly humorous 

example

cdstephens trump chuckled you mean the global poor


nazi mods

the moderators range from pretty cool to ok but they are all fash do not give the nazi mods an inch theyve done terrible things ranging from banning copypasta outright to removing shit memes on the subreddit any friendly interactions with the mods will be considered autocrat apologia and banned on sight 

swedes

the swedes range from pretty cool to ok but they are all succs do not give ulusvig alts an inch theyve done terrible things ranging from advocating for social democracy outright to complaining about swedish genocide on the subreddit any friendly interactions with the swedes will be considered autocrat apologia and banned on sight 


conclusion

thank you for reading this guide and i hope you already understand the dt and you wont panic because of misunderstanding it if this guide did not help you or you dont like the dt community do not read the dt at all if you do decide to partake the dt can get rather overwhelming at times with the number of people some of us maintain excel spreadsheets to cope and i suggest you do the same i can add some more content in the future just comment on this guide if you want to see something new but i probably wont get to it because im in grad school and spend most of my time shitposting peace

addendum

2025-02-10 06:59:31,ecuadors conservative incumbent and a leftist lawyer advance to presidential runoff,"ecuador will choose its next president in a runoff election after conservative incumbent daniel noboa and leftist lawyer luisa gonzlez garnered enough votes sunday to beat 14 other candidates

the contest set for april 13 will be a repeat of the october 2023 snap election that earned noboa a 16month presidency

noboa and gonzlez are now vying for a full fouryear term promising voters to reduce the widespread criminal activity that upended their lives four years ago

the spike in violence across the south american country is tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring colombia and peru so many voters have become crime victims that their personal and collective losses were a determining factor in deciding whether a third president in four years could turn ecuador around or if noboa deserved more time in office

noboa an heir to a fortune built on the banana trade and gonzlez the protge of ecuadors most influential president this century were the clear frontrunners ahead of the election

figures released by ecuadors national electoral council showed that with 80 of ballots tallied noboa received more than 371 million votes or 4443 while gonzlez earned over 369 million votes or 4417 the 14 other candidates in the race were far behind them",John3262005,neoliberal,1,21,https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-presidential-election-gonzalez-noboa-correa-crime-650a730693168df58914266fe3faa82c

2025-02-10 03:56:59,inside the house gop clash over tax cuts,"prominent house republicans are privately warring over how to advance tax cuts that are expiring and president donald trumps long list of other tax demands  with budget chair jodey arrington and deficit hardliner rep chip roy locked in a struggle against ways and means chair jason smith and other senior republicans

the dispute is hindering speaker mike johnson s plan to advance a budget blueprint this week as different gop factions continue to squabble over the costs of the tax plan how to offset them to reduce their deficit impact and possible costsaving changes to programs including medicare and assistance for lowincome americans

the unrest is reigniting house gop leaders concerns that roy and other hardliners are trying to burn time to undercut the leaders preference for a single bill that would include taxes border policy energy provisions and national security measures according to two republicans familiar with the conversations the senate favors a twotrack strategy that would include the border energy and defense measures in one bill and leave taxes for later in a separate bill

centrists and even some more conservative republicans are also increasingly alarmed that arrington keeps raising medicare reforms as a potential spending offset according to three republicans familiar with the ongoing talks trump made it clear on the campaign trail that he doesnt want to touch medicare but arrington has suggested a variety of changes to the program that would lower costs in the ways and means jurisdiction

house republicans from corngrowing states are also infuriated that arrington has his eye on slashing tax incentives for biofuels after a similar move almost blew up former speaker kevin mccarthys 2023 debt ceiling deal many agriculturestate republicans are already irritated at arrington for declining to help them press the congressional budget office for additional revenue for the farm bill last year and tempers are flaring again

republicans are also planning to include enacting the firstever work requirements for medicaid in the package according to two people familiar with the ongoing talks theyre also planning to expand work requirements for snap food aid benefits that help feed more than 40 million lowincome americans and a smaller cash assistance program known as temporary assistance for needy families",John3262005,neoliberal,16,65,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/09/house-gop-continues-squabble-budget-costs-critical-week-00203302

2025-02-10 03:39:37,court blocks us from sending 3 venezuelan migrants to guantnamo,"a federal judge barred the us government on sunday from sending three detained venezuelan men to the navy base at guantnamo bay cuba according to a lawyer for the migrants

lawyers for the men who are detained at an immigration and customs enforcement facility in new mexico asked the court on sunday evening for a temporary restraining order opening the first legal front against the trump administrations new policy of sending undocumented migrants to guantnamo

within an hour of the filing which came at the start of the super bowl judge kenneth j gonzales of the federal district court for new mexico convened a hearing by videoconference and verbally granted the restraining order said baher azmy the legal director of the center for constitutional rights which is helping represent the migrants

according to the filing the men are being held in the same ice facility the otero county processing center where previous groups of men who were flown to guantnamo in recent days had apparently been held the men recognized the faces of some of those detainees from government photographs provided to the news media the filing said

the filing also said that the men had heard rumors that more such transfers were coming and that they fit the profile of those the administration has prioritized for detention in guantnamo ie venezuelan men detained in the el paso area with false charges of connections with the tren de aragua gang

that lawsuit argues that the men cannot be held in perpetual detention and so must be freed their filing says that any transfer to guantnamo would make it difficult for them to continue to communicate with their lawyers and could open the door to the governments arguing that the court no longer has jurisdiction",John3262005,neoliberal,4,127,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/venezuelan-migrants-lawsuit-guantanamo.html

planned for many years the complex switch away from the grid of their former soviet imperial overlord is designed to integrate the three baltic nations more closely with the european union and to boost the regions energy security

after disconnecting on saturday from the ipsups network established by the soviet union in the 1950s and now run by russia the baltic nations cut crossborder highvoltage transmission lines in eastern latvia some 100 meters from the russian border handing out pieces of chopped wire to enthusiastic bystanders as keepsakes

eu foreign policy chief kaja kallas herself an estonian earlier this week called the switch a victory for freedom and european unity

the ipsups grid was the final remaining link to russia for the three countries which reemerged as independent nations in the early 1990s at the fall of the soviet union and joined the european union and nato in 2004

the three staunch supporters of kyiv stopped purchases of power from russia following moscows invasion of ukraine in 2022 but have relied on the russian grid to control frequencies and stabilize networks to avoid outages",John3262005,neoliberal,4,142,https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-states-switch-to-european-power-grid-ending-russia-ties-/7968415.html

2025-02-09 16:47:25,china to roll back clean power subsidies after boom,"chinas top economic planning agency said on sunday it was taking steps to scale back subsidies for renewable energy projects after a boom in solar and wind power installations

china broke its own records for new solar installations in 2024 with installed capacity up 45 from the previous year china now has almost 887 gw of installed solar power more than six times the capacity of the united states according to data from the international renewable energy agency

the surge in installations meant china hit its 2030 target six years ahead of schedule underscoring the speed of its clean energy rollout at a time when president donald trump has pulled the united states out of the paris climate deal for a second time and pledged to make it easier to drill for oil and gas

chinas national development and reform commission ndrc said together with chinas energy administration it had issued marketoriented changes to policies intended to encourage clean energy projects",John3262005,neoliberal,46,209,https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-roll-back-clean-power-subsidies-after-boom/7968356.html

2025-02-09 13:22:00,exclusive secret service airing recruitment ad from hollywood director michael bay during super bowl  cnn politics,"the united states secret service has tapped blockbuster movie director michael bay to create a recruiting advertisement that is expected to be unveiled in the stadium on super bowl sunday according to multiple nfl and secret service sources

the ad cost an estimated 2 million for the secret service to produce according to two sources familiar with the project  a hefty price tag that comes amid massive budget cuts and layoffs at other government agencies

one source told cnn the estimated 2 million budget is about double what was spent on previous secret service recruiting ads

the ad is expected to air during the pregame show on a jumbotron inside new orleans superdome stadium according to a source close to the nfl the ad time is being donated so the secret service will not have to pay an additional fee ad buys during super bowl sunday typically cost millions of dollars with a 30second ad airing on television costing up to 8 million this year

the ads purpose of recruitment comes at a crucial time as the secret service has been wracked with low morale burnout staffing and retention issues the thrust of the ad showcases the secret services role in protecting the nations leaders and points out the very game the audience is attending is secured by the agency according to sources familiar with the ad

according to sources familiar with the ad it includes images of secret service agents as well as former presidents including possible historic footage of john f kennedy and ronald reagan there is also expected to be an image of trump from the day of last years assassination attempt against him in butler pennsylvania however it is not clear what will make the final edit

the secret service will own the ad for five years and plans to use it on social media to drive future recruitment for years to come",John3262005,neoliberal,51,203,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/politics/secret-service-super-bowl-ad/index.html
2025-02-09 12:37:43,house republicans mull taxes on scholarships and changes to student loan programs,"as republicans in congress look for ways to slash spending some legislators are floating new taxes on college scholarships an end to student loan repayment plans and a big hike in taxes on university endowments

on the chopping block potentially are several plans students can opt into to repay their students loans including the save plan introduced by the biden administration that plan doesnt require borrowers to make payments if they earn less than 225 of the federal poverty line  32800 a year for a single person  and prevents interest from adding to balances as long as borrowers make their monthly payments the save plan was already put on hold after republicans challenged it some plans do not appear to be targeted including one that caps loan payments based on borrowers income level

another possible change would give borrowers additional opportunities to recover from defaults while they currently can rehabilitate their loans just once allowing them to make a certain number of consecutive payments to get out of default the proposal would allow them to go through that process twice the committee projected the new process could save the government millions of dollars but did not spell out how

scholarships and fellowships have been exempt from taxes as long as they are used for tuition and related expenses that would change under another proposal thats up for consideration

the tax cuts and jobs act currently requires some private nonprofit colleges and universities to pay a 14 tax on income from their endowments which raised about 244 million from 58 institutions in 2022 the committee suggests increasing that to a 14 tax and expanding which colleges would have to pay it

also being considered among hundreds of other ideas in circulation are fines for colleges and universities that violate students rights under title vi of the civil rights act which protects against discrimination toward students of shared ancestry such investigations often have been resolved through settlements calling for training and policy updates title vi is currently what is being used to investigate complaints of antisemitism on college campuses across the us",John3262005,neoliberal,112,327,https://apnews.com/article/trump-administration-education-college-loans-532d52c2ccac8b4be459f7797fb63a73

2025-02-08 23:04:38,trumps federal hiring freeze halts onboarding of federal firefighting crews ahead of wildfire season  cnn,"the federal hiring freeze implemented by president donald trump has affected the hiring of a crucial group of federal workers firefighters

the freeze comes at a critical time when fire departments across the country would typically onboard thousands of seasonal federal firefighters in preparation for wildfires in the spring and summer

federal firefighters are an essential part of the nations firefighting capability the department of the interior employed 5780 federal wildland fire personnel in 2024 while the us forest service employed over 11300

the freeze means that fire trucks in utah could be left with two people per truck instead of four or five  and some trucks wont be staffed at all according to cnn affiliate ksl

the effect on firefighters comes because the white house has not said that firefighters fall under those essential services and thus warrant an exemption from the freeze according to mclane

similarly gutierrez said we havent heard anything from the agency whether they had filed an exemption or not because theres been no communication referring both to the department of interior and the department of agriculture",John3262005,neoliberal,16,204,https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/us/firefighters-federal-hiring-freeze/index.html

2025-02-08 20:35:28,usda freezes farmer funding for some programs conservation contracts,"the us department of agriculture has frozen some funding for farmers as it goes through a sweeping review despite assurances from the trump administration that programs helping farmers would not be affected in the government overhaul

the impact has been immediate and wideranging from cash assistance for ranchers to fix cattle watering systems to help for corn growers wanting to plant cover crops that curb wind erosion

some of the money that has been frozen is tied to environmental conservation programs that were funded by former president joe bidens signature climate law the 2022 inflation reduction act which included about 195 billion for farm programs over 10 years

the white house said its january 27 proposal to freeze federal loans and grants would not affect programs for farmers the administration rescinded its proposal and it has been temporarily blocked in court the white house did not respond to a request for comment on friday

2025-02-08 19:48:49,when is it pragmatic to fight a different battle,"this post is less about data and stats and more of a tangent and thought experiment 

choosing to not doom about the western world specifically whats happening in america is really tough right now were seeing realtime validation of some very bad case scenarios institutions are being crushed and foundational laws are being ignored in a way thats unprecedented by the executive office and the muskivites 

weve already seen evidence that trump is comfortable subverting democracy weve already seen evidence hes shored up bulletproof support among his party 

weve now also seen evidence that he has the new tactical ability to tangibly steamroll his way to what he wants much more predictably than ever before 

my main question is if we zoom out is this battle already over and when is it pragmatic to fight a different battle

of course that doesnt mean its time to stop organizing or voting or donating to the voices and politicians that push back and stand up to have another go in two amp four years but that path is becoming incredibly narrow

we probably havent come to terms that there are now thumbs on the scale of social media and how the majority of winnable voters access their information amp are influenced more strongly than we can understand even if we see the obvious on twitter theres a good chance that liberals and progressives are already a mile behind with a broken leg the eventual groundswell of support we all assume will come might just never show up

the reality is that illiberal actors have functionally unlimited resources musk sycophants controlling the mechanisms for consequence and years to do whatever the hell they want with america

even if its always worth fighting for liberal values and principles the battle for america feels more like a landslide than a descent 2024 was the battle you had to win and you didnt

so if you were to arrive at this conclusion what comes next

lets for this argument write off what the democrats can do in the next four years as some amount of stalling and mitigation during the avalanche

why do we believe in liberal values why do we think theyre correct

i think it usually comes down to empathy liberals arent the only people with empathy obviously but i believe it plays a huge role in why we see some of smartest people stand up and fight to take a harder road to bring home better outcomes basically the antithesis of populism 

i think we are motivated by capitalism and the good we can do in the framework because of the 10 decreases in poverty or 5 increases in quality of lives lived and the freedom you have to express your ideas because they might be better ones we havent considered 

this is why it sucks to see institutions that do real good get crushed and why were so disgusted by populism

if were assuming that maga has won with some kind of permanence the most pragmatic way to advance those values might be different than sliding down the avalanche

parties people and movements change right now there is a big absence of empathy in maga and in america and i feel thats an element at play maybe there are more levers here and maybe its more pragmatic to try to pull them 

what can we do now culturally to drive more empathy if we can do that does liberalism or elements of it become some sort of eventuality can it be lateral to politics are we seeing signals this can happen anywhere right now 

what i want to try to understand more is if theres a lever for maga  conservatives and america as a country to become more influenced by empathy and even if thats a narrow road if its more feasible and pragmatic in getting us back to the fight for good outcomes than the fight for what could be the dying breath of an unorganized opposition to a new regime 

maybe being radically kind to folks in your life who dont deserve it could be more powerful over the curve of the next 15 years than anything you could do for the democrats today maybe theres more value in finding new ways to communicate classic principles even separate from politics in a way that resonates with new generations even if its not about immediate policy or learning how to start painting the picture of what we had yesterday and what good liberalism did for so many people for so long in a way that gives everyone ambition amp hope for the future when things get tough even if their vehicle to be ambitious and hopeful isnt the democratic party or the institutions youd recognize from today 

the future needs smart people thats a constant and theyre always going to have some sort of power theyll also have new tools to action it that we cant imagine yet 

smart people are always going to be interested in solving hard problems that part in my view is not going to change 

just riffing trying to find a different road for hopium and outlook on how to do good in a world that seems to want to reject it



edit a few folks think im talking about changing strategy in messaging im talking about the pragmatic way liberalism or parts of it can survive even if the battle for democracy is already lost how good attributes and values can make their way into whatever the future state is through other levers even if its not functioning democracy republican  maga doesnt have to be the same entity forever even if the vehicle of the party captures the system and ends democracy",WandangleWrangler,neoliberal,31,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1ikvvso/when_is_it_pragmatic_to_fight_a_different_battle/

2025-02-08 14:37:12,trump chops away at the government and the fallout is felt in the virginia governors race,"the trump administrations aggressive push to cut government jobs is reverberating in the early stages of this years race for governor in virginia

the fastmoving effort by republican president donald trump to overhaul the federal workforce could have a sweeping impact in the state home to some 145000 federal employees and many more government contractors virginia which along with new jersey is picking a new governor in 2025 is already regarded as something of an early indicator of voter attitudes between presidential elections and seems certain to attract closer attention as the contest takes shape

whether that view is widely shared will be tested in virginia where a former democratic congresswoman abigail spanberger and the republican lieutenant governor winsome earlesears are the leading contenders for governor the primaries are in june

earlesears said taxpayers do not want to pay more than is needed for their government and that what trump is doing should come as no surprise

2025-02-08 13:50:32,republicans retool their parents rights playbook for the virginia governors race,"republicans managed to flip the virginia governorship in 2021 largely on an education platform focusing on parents concerns over peakpandemic public school closings and racebased curricula

four years later the party is aiming to retool its parents rights campaign in its bid to hold on to the office in the blueleaning state in a postcovid era

republicans in recent years have sought to expand their education and cultural playbook in virginia and around the country while republicans once zeroed in on critical race theory the target is now diversity equity and inclusion policies and theyve broadened their focus to preventing transgender students from competing in girls and womens sports

this falls governors race which both parties will look to as a bellwether of the broader political environment will provide a major test of the messages staying power

youngkin is termlimited leading to open primaries on both sides but there are already clear frontrunners for both parties on the republican side lt gov winsome earlesears is the only serious candidate for democrats former rep abigail spanberger is the only declared candidate although rep bobby scott is thought to be exploring a run

2025-02-08 13:41:23,us aid agencys climate programs aimed to curb migration now theyre gone,"two months ago the biden administration announced an initiative to share satellite data with central american countries including guatemala honduras and el salvador to help them prepare for severe storms

the goal was twofold in a region vulnerable to hurricanes and other calamities made worse by a warming climate reducing the damage would help ease suffering it would also relieve the pressure to migrate to the united states and at 66 million the project run by the us agency for international development and nasa cost a tiny fraction of what the federal government spends on border security

that program along with a suite of other development projects designed to reduce the flow of people from central america to the us border now seems to be over the day he took office mr trump signed an order freezing usaid spending on friday he proposed closing the agency entirely the state department has assumed responsibility for the agency which is set to lose 97 percent of its staff

the state department did not respond to questions about whether it planned to continue the climate adaptation programs in central america  and if not whether it had alternative plans for reducing migration pressure from the region

in other words climate shocks wouldnt compel so many people to leave the country if they could better protect themselves financially against extreme events

as the link between climate change and migration in central america was becoming clearer the biden administration began helping to make those countries more resilient to extreme weather

us development programs aimed at increasing climate resilience were not in place long enough to show evidence of success said gillian caldwell the chief climate officer at usaid during the biden administration but it stands to reason that these make incredible contributions to reducing outmigration",John3262005,neoliberal,4,74,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/climate/us-aid-climate-migration.html

trump says his sweeping agenda of deregulation increased oil production and lower taxes will unlock growth and beat back inflation  an argument strongly endorsed by the american people in the election but a broadbased crackdown on immigrants could slow the economys expansion and choke off a supply of workers that kansas city fed researchers and others say have alleviated staffing shortages and eased wage pressures",John3262005,neoliberal,4,18,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/07/immigration-job-gains-down-00203005

in a suit against the agency filed in november 276 immigrants  from former soviet countries including russia georgia and kazakhstan  nearly half of whom are being held in louisiana  claim that they are being wrongfully denied release from ice detention the reason according to the suit is an unwritten policy of categorically denying release requests from russianspeaking asylumseekers who originate from countries that were once part of the soviet union in an alleged attempt by the agency to deter others from the former soviet bloc from the attempting to enter the united states

their attorneys call it the russian detention amp deterrence scheme

in some cases the alleged scheme has left detainees separated from their children  who have been taken to separate facilities  for months

if the plaintiffs claims are true the agencys actions would violate federal laws meant to safeguard against arbitrary and capricious enforcement the plaintiffs due process rights under the fifth amendment to the us constitution and an internal government policy meant to guarantee fairness in asylum proceedings according to the lawsuit

the sources said immigration and customs enforcement ice is preparing to publish in the coming days a request for proposal that will ask private prison companies to bid for contracts to restart detention facilities intended specifically for families 

the obama and first trump administrations detained parents with their children but the biden administration ended that in early 2021 under the terms of a 1997 court settlement ice is prohibited from holding families with children in regular ice detention settings and must hold them for less than 21 days

the biden administration allowed undocumented immigrant families making their way through the immigration system to live in the united states while the head of the household was enrolled in a geolocating monitoring program such as through an ankle monitor even if the family was slated to be deported

since president donald trump took office again last month most of the arrests by ice that have been publicized have been of single adult men

that could soon change once family detention centers are brought back online the two existing facilities ready to take in migrant families are in karnes texas which has previously been run by geo group and has the capacity to hold over 3000 people and in dilley texas which can hold up to 830 people and was previously run by core civic according to the facilities web sites dilley is currently closed but being maintained while karnes is currently holding adult ice detainees and would have to change over to a family facility again",John3262005,neoliberal,9,44,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna191230

2025-02-07 13:38:19,trump steps in to help resolve the golf war,"never mind gaza or global trade president donald trump has been using his negotiating skills on something perhaps closer to his heart golf

pga tour commissioner jay monahan and playerdirector adam scott met with trump in the white house this week for help working out an investment deal with the saudibacked liv golf tour  and appear to have made some progress

the pga and saudi arabias sovereign wealth fund have been working on the details of an investment deal since june 2023 when they announced an agreement to end the legal battle sparked by the launch of the liv professional mens tour two years prior

the 2023 agreement called for a deadline of december of 2023 that came and went with no finalized deal

trumps involvement isnt surprising given his well known affection for the game ownership of golf courses around the world and relatively friendly relations with saudi arabia  whose de facto leader crown prince mohammed bin salman was the first foreign leader the president called after taking office in january mbs as hes known was also the first foreign leader trump visited in his first term",John3262005,neoliberal,5,9,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/06/trump-gold-pga-tour-saudi-00203019

2025-02-07 04:51:21,some hope for ukraine with trump,"i did not support donald trump last election nor did i support him any election as a matter of fact one of my main reasons for that were his statements regarding the russian invasion of ukraine which i found troubling at least

but i still have some hope for ukraine in this new trump era why you may ask

because if you remove the dialectic and slogans out of it for example his outrageous statements in helsinki in 2018 at least during his first administration trump was actually a pretty solid president when it came to russia and ukraine

first of all he strengthened nato the other nato countries werent paying their fair share and trump pressured them to start paying their dues not only the us didnt leave nato under trump but thanks to his efforts over 400 billion extra funding for nato a stronger nato is a weaker putin always you can question the methods but not the results trump also signed off natos biggest expansion since the cold war approving montenegro and north macedonias accession he also pushed for increased nato naval patrols in the black sea to counter russia

trump increased us military footprint in poland in 2020 with the enhanced defense cooperation agreement he deployed more troops also to the baltic states and romania us naval activity in the black sea was increased we all know what a strong message this sends to putin

while obama refused to send lethal aid to ukraine even after crimea trump in 2017 approved the sale of javelin antitank missiles to ukraine and sent 15 billion in military aid

trump actually sanctioned russian oligarchs companies and banks and expelled 60 russian diplomats after the skripal poisoning he went after the energy sector stateowned companies and putins friends trump also withdrew from the inf treaty after accusing russia of violations

trump also fought like hell against nord stream 2 if you dont remember thats the russian pipeline to germany and imposed sanctions on companies involved with the construction delaying the completion he actually warned europe against the reliance on russian energy and they literally laughed at his face 

compare this to president obama who refused to send lethal aid to ukraine even after crimea with his own generals and defense secretary pushing for it and instead imposed weak sanctions that failed to deter russian advances the reset policy was a failure and he practiced appeasement cancelling defense systems in poland and the czech republic and leaving nato allies vulnerable to appease russia

or to president biden who lifted trumps sanctions on nord stream 2 as one of his first major fp moves this was a gift to putin his chaotic withdrawal from afghanistan projected weakness less than six months later russian tanks were in ukraine and in the leadup to the invasion biden ignored ukrainians calls for more weapons in order to negotiate with putin something that obviously didnt work while i recognize his ability of rallying nato the truth is he hesitated sending advanced weaponry because he feared escalation and made them fight with sovietera equipment and he sent abrams tanks and f16s due to congressional pressure and too late he failed to establish a clear victory strategy

and one important thing we need to take into account is that everything trump cares about is been seen as a winner he isnt interested in a peace treaty in ukraine that gives russia a victory because it will make him look weak when he will do anything in order to project strength he will not let ukraine be his afghanistan

trump has also shown he is much more pragmatic and politicallysavvy than his loyalists example of this is supporting for the republican senate leadership john thune a competent person who by the way is a staunch supporter of ukraine before a maga name like rick scott already in his first days in office he took a tough approach on putin i think he is destroying russia by not making a deal  zelensky wants to make a deal i dont know if putin does he might not i dont know

should we then take for granted trump will save ukraine absolutely not we need to still fight for a cause worth fighting for but we need to understand that while there are tulsi gabbards in the white house now the most dangerous nomination in the century there are also mike waltzs the national security advisor and a ukraine hardliner we should know about the outrageous comments trump did on ukraine but we should also know he did hell of a job for them the first time and we need to steer the ship in that direction now

we need to know the facts we need to have hope

weird to say but i hope at least on this matter 47 looks like 45

the memo also orders agencies to identify any barriers to an agency having the ability to swiftly terminate poor performing employees who cannot or will not improve

the memo orders agencies to disclose the name job title pay plan duty station and other details of employees who received a performance rating below fully successful in recent years

it also asks if that employee is under or successfully completed a performance improvement plan within the last 12 months and whether the agency has already proposed and issued a decision on efforts to demote or remove that worker for performancebased reasons

in at least one case at the energy department a supervisor was given 20 minutes to turn around the justifications they were limited to 200 characters per employee including spaces 

the directive came from the office of personnel management and follows the human resources agency asking every agency for lists of employees still on their probationary periods such workersusually those hired within the last one or two years depending on their hiring mechanismcan typically be fired quickly and without much recourse sparking concerns the trump administration is planning to dismiss them in droves 

that supervisor was also included on the list and now fears for their job 

an opm official said the directives were given to agencies that had not yet fully complied with their previous guidance which it issued on president trumps first day in office similar instructions were given to the internal revenue service and at least some other agencies with an equally tight deadline according to a source familiar with the process

but a closer look at these ice reports tells a different story

that fourday operation in colorado it happened in november 2010 the 123 people targeted in new orleans that was february of last year wisconsin september 2018 there are thousands of examples of this throughout all 50 states  ice press releases that have reached the first page of google search results making it seem like enforcement actions just happened when in actuality they occurred months or years ago some such as the arrest of 44 absconders in nebraska go back as far as 2008

all the archived ice press releases soaring to the top of google search results were marked with the same timestamp and read updated 01242025

the mystery first caught the attention of an immigration lawyer who began tracking ice raids and enforcement actions when donald trump took office she spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the administration at first she was baffled when she clicked on these seemingly new press releases and they detailed ice raids from more than a decade ago

since the guardian reached out to ice and google for comment some of the press releases have reverted back to their original dates on google search therefore those releases are no longer appearing at the top of google search results",John3262005,neoliberal,8,132,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/06/ice-us-immigration-deportations-google

2025-02-06 03:02:56,education department staff warned that trump buyout offers could be canceled at any time,"top officials at the department of education told staff wednesday that if they accept the trump administrations deferred resignation package the education secretary may later cancel it and employees would not have any recourse potentially leaving them without promised pay 

the office of personnel management sent notices last week to federal employees that if they resign by feb 6 they could continue receiving pay and benefits until the end of september the trump administration is hoping to get as many as 10 of the workforce to quit as part of a plan to shrink the federal bureaucracy 

but three education department officials told nbc news that rachel oglesby the departments new chief of staff and jacqueline clay chief human capital officer described significant caveats to the socalled fork in the road offer in an allstaff meeting held over zoom on wednesday the officials did not want to be named for fear of retaliation 

the education secretary would be allowed to rescind the agreement or the government could stop paying and employees who took the deferred resignation package would waive all legal claims the three officials said they were told in the meeting the three employees say they have only seen sample resignation agreements so far and would need to agree to resign by thursday evening before they see the actual terms of their separation 

a spokesperson for the office of personnel management said that this was false and pointed to a memo that states the resignation offers assurances are binding on the government were the government to backtrack on its commitments an employee would be entitled to request a rescission of his or her resignation however the memo includes a sample agreement that includes a clause that agency heads retain the sole discretion to rescind the deal and employees waive the right to challenge it before the merit systems protection board or any other forum

there is deep concern among federal workers that the trump administrations buyout offer could turn out to be a baitandswitch with the government potentially failing to hold up its end of the bargain the comments from education department management only worsened those concerns the three employees said",John3262005,neoliberal,7,80,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/buyout-trump-offer-workforce-resignation-musk-doge-opm-education-rcna190881

fagan a fourstar admiral and the first woman to lead a branch of the military was removed from her post as the coast guards top officer on trumps second day in office officials at the homeland security department  which oversees the coast guard  cited border security issues and an excessive focus on diversity equity and inclusion among the reasons for her dismissal

coast guard leaders had given fagan a 60day waiver to find new housing according to one of the sources but on tuesday homeland security officials told the acting commandant kevin lunday that he had to kick her out because the president wants her out of quarters according to one of the people familiar with the incident

the dhs official was not able to immediately ascertain whether the directive had in fact come from trump or whether his name had been invoked without his knowledge

lunday then informed fagan at 2 pm tuesday that she had three hours to get out shortly after that her team received a call from aides to sean plankey a dhs senior adviser and retired coast guard officer instructing her to leave the house unlocked so that the interior could be photographed according to one of the sources

the dismissals deal a severe blow to the bureau because the contractors were mostly technical or area experts whom senior officials relied on to do the daytoday work of enacting the programs overseas

the bureau has received about 150 million to 200 million of annual budget funding from congress in recent years but the bureau also handles and passes on money that congress appropriates for other groups including the national endowment for democracy

the bureaus programs have often been focused on building up civil society and democratic practices in countries where the united states does not have missions and formal diplomatic ties or where relations with an authoritarian government are especially tense this includes russia china iran north korea venezuela and cuba

some of the bureaus contractors have specific technical expertise for example at least one is an expert on virtual private networks software that allows users to get around government internet blocks china has the most effective internet censorship program in the world called the great firewall

the bureau has also worked on enacting policies aimed at pressuring china to relent on its forced labor of uyghur muslims including the imposing of sanctions on us companies that buy products that can be traced back to some form of forced labor",John3262005,neoliberal,3,99,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/us/politics/democracy-human-rights-fired.html

2025-02-05 18:57:08,french pm bayrou survives noconfidence vote thanks to far right,"french prime minister franois bayrou will live to fight another day after getting a helping hand from marine le pens troops

bayrou survived a noconfidence vote on wednesday night after the national rally decided against toppling the government over its budget only 128 lawmakers voted in favor of the measure far below the 289 threshold it needed to pass

speaking on behalf of the national rally before the vote lawmaker yoann gillet slammed the censure as a masquerade and said it made little mathematical sense for his party to back the measure as it appeared to lack the support needed to get the green light even with the far rights votes gillet made it clear however that his party did not support bayrous spending plans calling them a racket organized on the backs of those who work and produce in our country

bayrou conceded that the budget was imperfect shortly before the vote however he stressed that it was necessary to get something passed to bring stability to france which has relied on a stopgap spending measure after failing to pass a budget last year bayrou added that it was crucial for france to get its finances in order as it faces advancing tsunamis including the ukraine war and the upheaval wrought by us president donald trump 

to pass his budget bayrou twice on monday triggered a constitutional clause allowing him to push through legislation without a vote in parliament but then allows lawmakers to bring forward noconfidence motions",John3262005,neoliberal,13,40,https://www.politico.eu/article/france-far-right-set-to-keep-pm-francois-bayrou-in-office-on-budget-no-confidence-vote/

2025-02-05 18:00:08,america versus the world,"two months ago i wrote this thread that sought to articulate the critical problems with trump distinct from the merely stupid offensive and painful in short i argued that the us turning its back on the liberal world order would make the world much less safe and prosperous and is a huge step backwards for mankind

since then two new and unexpected developments have occured at least in their swiftness and severity the first is that musk has shown remarkable zeal in dismantling the us government and his alliance with trump has left congressional republicans never progovernment types anyways silent the only remaining defensethe judicial systemis far too slow to stop let alone repair the damage while the us government does have genuine bloat and waste this is throwing dynamite to clean out your broom closet and the real goal and result is to hamstring the last national stalwart defender of the liberal world order the us civil service

the second problem is that trump is sounding shockingly aggressive and violent all of a sudden he has floated conquest displacement if not genocide and economic pain for pains sake it cannot be stressed enough that this is causing the leaders and top brass of every country to seriously reassess their relationship with the us and their national security strategy moving forward

i have long believed and argued to my detriment that politically active people handwring and demonize others needlessly it creates a boy cries wolf situation where we soon lack the vocabulary to proclaim a real threat when it materializes donald trump has now egregiously moved beyond the pale from merely bringing about uncertainty and economic pain to suddenly attacking our allys core interests this is a prelude to cold and hot wars we have no effective way of communicating this because democrats already call trump the devil republicans either like this stuff or are deaf to dem warnings and the last third of america are blind to politics more broadly but to put things lightly we now have a wolf on our hands and the policy makers of other countries are probably the only ones to see it

friends no more

europe prepared for a trump presidency essentially in financial terms the damage he would do could be measured in dollars it was still expected he would use the american military to protect the oceans for trade to encourage stability in the me to prevent chinese aggression and give europe a nuclear umbrella trump at worst would leave nato but russia is exhausted in ukraine and poland is arming itself to the teeth so the eu could tolerate that if worst came to worst

that calculus has now changed the uss major economic and military ally europe is starting to feel more threated by the us than helped by it the recent threats to mexico and canadawhich are essentially us vassalswere so nonsensical as to amount to sadomasochism europe has begun to internalize that the us is threatening a trade war not for any addressable concern but as an end onto itself pain for its own sake trump allying with prorussian european populists and utilizing musks disinformation to reinforce that coming out of the kremlin might be tolerated so long as the us helped in ukraine but with that help evaporating the europeans dont even know what theyre gaining with america as a friend anymore by many metrics the us is now sounding and acting very much like an enemy

on top of all this is a return to imperial language which the us very much has the ability to carry out trump attacking international norms and recognizing landgrabs sets the stage for the us to do the same the republican talkingpoints that this rhetoric along with trade war threats is simply 4d chess leverage is not taken seriously by the policy makers of the world the small victories for trump are insignificant other countries must consider and do consider and will start to wargame for these threats to be acted upon

america who needs em

if we lose europe as an ally the blow to our power would be immense we lose our democratic bridgehead in eurasia and a contested atlantic even becomes a remote possibility meanwhile weve failed to bring latin america and africa to our side so trump is simply cutting most foreign aid and just handing them to china with the expectation that threatsdeals can extract concessions from them when needed this ignores the role these continents will play in the coming century especially when looking at demographic trends

india brazil and to a lesser extent turkey are geopolitical neutrals anyways israel and sa will stick with us as long as iran is a thing which it might not always be that basically leaves southeast asia as the last area that really needs us as a military hedge against the other big gorilla in the room leaving the tpp signaled that were a less reliable trading partner than china itself but as our friends dwindle and the atlantic and south america move further out of our orbit even the rise of china is not enough of a unifying threat to keep the pacific in our pocket for much longer

china

europe honestly doesnt care much about taiwan outside of semiconductors its a pacific not atlantic problem and the business with china isnt worth risking the rest of the stuff china does is manageable and its competing with russia in eurasia anyways in fact europe aligns with china in many ways by wanting to keep the world order alive china chiefly wants to supplant americas influence globally and gain military hegemony in its own backyard its not clear that china has territorial ambitions beyond that which suits europe just fine

this means the us really needs japan australia india and to a lesser extent south koreaphilippinesvietnamindonesia to help in containing china but trump doesnt really hate china eitherhis only concern seems to be the trade deficitso if america does not stop the chinese conquest of taiwan and its quite possible china can and will take it in the next 25 years that puts japan and south korea in incredibly vulnerable positions and they may well be forced to choose between allout war or accepting chinese hegemony and its likely we simply lose them as allies too the entire strategic situation then changes dramatically and it becomes hard to forecast things but i want to suggest that the us and china are precluding any possibility of a pragmatic compromise between the countriesboth are demonizing each other as national policies and trump is trying to dismantle trade but if we give up taiwan were going to be in an even worse position to counter their influence and may well have to live with a hostile neighbor which will probably lead to an even worse war sometime later on or well need to accept china as a regional partner which is complicated and anyway puts them on a collision course with a number of other strong powers japan and india in particular and i dont know how that will resolve itself peacefully 

in short the whole alliance structure of the region can unravel if taiwan is given up which puts the most important artery of global trade in jeopardy for the foreseeable future

what have we got to lose

the above conjecture of spoiling our alliances fits right in line with trumps vision of returning us and the world to the 19th century where we still have our enormous powerbase of north america white men rule the land but now we got nukes the concern that now most of the world is hostile to us probably wont matter as our old enemies are given their desired spheres of influence on a platter and regional rivalries will flare up and distract our old allies with new geopolitical realities in fact lots of countries will shamelessly court the us for assistance leading to more transactional regional foreign policy instead of some global grand strategy

meanwhile mexico and canada will not be a threat for the foreseeable future and we can be energy independent if need be andor conquer venezuela greenland panama and canada are fundamentally defensive conquests in that they reinforce us control over north america i have no idea wtf trump is on about re gaza and sure americans will be poorer without trade but so will the rest of the world and without the usled alliance structures its a strong possibility that regional conflicts will prevent mass freetrading blocks to outcompete the na economy

of course that is the best case scenario with this antiquated outlook in all likelihood regional wars will escalate until great powers become involved and the us is inevitably dragged into conflicts overseas under unfavorable terms or soros willing some areas retain large trading blocs wherein the us is eventually out competed economically either way countries will begin to deceive resist and hedge against a hostile america and well pay far greater regular costs than what we paid for when we had them as friends we will resemble another china to many countries wherein they may do shortterm economic or even military deals with us but do not fundamentally trust us and actively work to subvert our power given every available opportunity

his lasting legacy

the first 100 days was hoped to be the worst trump could offer as the presidents popularity with the american people and republican party are at their peak many lowhanging executive orders can be signed and theres still two years left until a midterm but knowing this the speed at which musktrump is destroying our soft power the inability of anyone to stop them and the free reign trump has to enact the new world disorder will last far far longer than his mere 4 years in power

best case scenario europe mexico and canada appease trump enough to keep our relationships alive taiwan survives this presidency the rest of the world continues using international institutions dems win congress in the midterms renewable energy technology advances trading blocs reconfigure without the us but including china global rising real incomes continue to promote democracy the us navy still patrols the worlds oceans for pirates

but realistically nato wont make as much sense for europeans who ironically may try to improve relations with russia to combat american aggression and taiwan remains a giant question mark hanging over allies in the pacific even the middle east may abandon the us if israel normalizes relations with the sunnis america and russia may succeed in ruining all international orgs even as china poisons them the dems win marginally during the midterms if at all the climate propels towards the 3c heating mark democracy backsliding continues aided by technological misinformation warfare and nuclear proliferation ignites all over the globe as a new security disorder manifests

is there any hope

i dont see many opportunities for reversing the above trends the populist nationalist movements across the free world especially the rightwing ones need to die out and the next administrations of russia and china need to be more pragmatic the solution to social media misinformation needs to be discovered

and most of all the american people need to punish the republicans enough in 2026 amp 2028 to give both the democrats and gop a path forward after trump the wallstreet wing of the gop still likes trade dems are ironically now more freetrade and pronato because of trump reactionism and trump is literally the only prochina person in the government the maga crowd are the most dangerous ideologues and theres a shot maga etiolates after their god is gone

but most most of all the rest of the world needs to rebuild the liberal world order and not just the european elite or us democrats the world needs to stop playing the great powers off of each other or lamely ask what the un is gonna do for them open markets open borders open societies open progress and open minds are what lead to an open future thats the key

but alas some say the lwo died in 2008 i think thats when its decline started but it lasted a good 17 years after that 2025 is when it was killed i could be wrong i hope i am but if the pattern of the past two weeks hold im not in fact the pain has only just begun",MegasBasilius,neoliberal,17,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1iig9hm/america_versus_the_world/

the moves largely centered in solidly red states at the outset of trumps second term underscore the political grip he has on the gop base and the desire of elected officials in the party to be seen as nothing less than loyal to him

the letter asks for a list of employees that installed the equipment the authority under which they were hired and whether they faced background investigations  a nod to a reddit post saying employees outside opm installed the server

the installation of the server appears to have been a stepping stone in opms work to assemble a list of federal employee emails ahead of offering the fork in the road buyout package to nearly all employees  a brainchild of elon musk

but in doing so opm may have violated laws dictating how the agency must plan for using databases with personally identifiable information

at best the trump administrations actions at opm to date demonstrate gross negligence severe incompetence and a chaotic disregard for the security of our government data and the countless services it enables our agencies to provide to the public said the letter from rep gerry connolly va the house oversight and government reform committees top democrat and rep shontel brown dohio

its a significant number of people  about 1 of the federal workforce  but still substantially less than the white houses target of 5 to 10

the offer is open through thursday meaning the total could rise despite heavy opposition from unions and others

aside from the pace of resignations the official said the administration is still trying to implement a hiring freeze it has proven trickier than expected because some agencies are still taking on new workers

critics argue the offer is illegal theres no real guarantee people will get paid out and its something congress would need to authorize the administration rejects those assertions and says its following through on a promise to restructure the federal government

the announcement effectively ends much of murphys sevenyear agenda to spur a clean energy and green economy revolution in the garden state and echoes setbacks in new york and california

it also stymies the aspirations former president joe biden had planned for a green future that is more reliant on wind than fossil fuels while handing a victory to trump who favors coal oil and natural gas

so far only four small wind projects have been built another six have state contracts and federal permits  and are expected to move forward this year

ironically perhaps the industrys biggest bright spot is in a state led by a republican governor the nations largest offshore wind project is not only under construction but proceeding apace off the coast of hampton roads in virginia the company behind it dominion energy expects to finish construction next year and said it continues to enjoy robust bipartisan support from virginia government and congressional leaders local communities defense interests commercial marine industry civic educational environmental labor and community partners",John3262005,neoliberal,46,169,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/04/trump-new-jersey-wind-energy-00202248

johnson and house gop leaders repeatedly said that they wanted to start the legislative process on the measure encompassing much of trumps agenda by advancing a budget resolution out of committee this week but a source told the hill on monday that the vote will not take place this week amid jockeying among republicans over how deep the spending cuts should ultimately be

the decision to delay the markup comes after leadership presented lawmakers with a framework that proposed 500 billion in spending cuts rep ralph norman rsc a member of the house budget committee told the hill the blueprint came after johnson last week said he wanted that number to be a floor and not a ceiling to give committees flexibility when crafting the ultimate bill which is subject to strict budget reconciliation rules

but norman  who is also a member of the conservative house freedom caucus  called that figure a nonstarter and he said he is pushing for a bottomline figure between 2 trillion and 5 trillion

the early obstacle for the gops sweeping legislation  which republicans say will include an extension of tax cuts border enforcement funding and energy priorities  is a concerning sign for johnson as he looks to send the bill to trumps desk by easter or memorial day a timeline some republicans admit will be difficult to achieve

senterpartiet left the government a week ago due to terrible polling and used the implementation of three eu directives as excuse arbeiderpartiet were left as the sole government party and are presenting their new government today the centrepiece of the new government is the return of jens stoltenberg to norwegian politics he has been prime minister 3 times and also finance minister for a year but is obviously most know internationally for his very long stint as natoboss

both stoltenberg and his close friend pm jonas gahr stre are pro eu and free trade replacing former finance minister vedum with stoltenberg is like trading anthony davis for luka doncic

2025-02-04 11:00:38,its wrong to use elon to get away with antiafrikaner bigotry,"elon musk is an oligarch who is undermining the institutions of the united states in a grotesque and unacceptable fashion he is someone that liberals should oppose but this opposition should not veer into bigotry in the last few months reddit has been filled with comments disparaging elon on the basis of his race and ethnicity these are wrong on so many levels that it is unbelievable and discredits legitimate criticism of musk

first and foremost no individual should be judged on the basis of their group membership and no group should be judged by the action of one individual that applies to white people just as much as any other group the idea that elon does what he does because he is a white south african or afrikaner is wrong in fact it is racist and the broad insults lobbied against those groups under the banner of insulting musk are wrong racism is bad 

clever historical observations and witty jokes are one thing but people repeatedly calling for elon an american citizen to be deported back to africa and asking what you would expect of an afrikaner is wrong they would sound disgusting if elon was black they are equally disgusting even though he is white

secondly and more embarassingly elon musk is literally not an afrikaner there are two major white ethnic groups in south africa english and afrikaner elon is english

thirdly if you really really do want to play the game of ethnic and ancestral guilt then you should know that on his mothers side elon is from north america his mother was born in canada and her father was born in the united states but raised in canada if you really feel that elons present beliefs must be attributed to his ancestry then you are probably better off blaming it on his north american ancestors than his south african ones elons dad was a member of the progressive party which opposed apartheid in south africa elons grandfather on the other hand

gt in 1950 he emigrated with his family to south africa and settled in the capital pretoria where he opened a chiropractic clinic he served as secretary of the south african chiropractors association saca from 1952 to 1959 after which he was its president until 1969

gt haldeman was a supporter of south africas apartheid policies and the ruling national party of south africa telling a reporter for the extremist die transvaler newspaper a tool of the nazis in south africa during world war ii instead of the governments attitude keeping me out of south africa it had precisely the opposite effectit encouraged me to come and settle here2 in 1951 he wrote an article about south africa for the saskatchewan newspaper the regina leaderpost defending apartheid and writing of black south africans the natives are very primitive and must not be taken seriously some are quite clever in a routine job but the best of them cannot assume responsibility and will abuse authority the present government of south africa knows how to handle the native question

elons americancanadian grandfather was a member of the technocracy movement which was an american and canadian movement that was illegal in canada their beliefs

gt technocracy is the science of social engineering the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent for the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific technical engineering problem there will be no place for politics or politicians finance or financiers rackets or racketeers technocracy states that this method of operating the social mechanism of the north american continent is now mandatory because we have passed from a state of actual scarcity into the present status of potential abundance in which we are now held to an artificial scarcity forced upon us in order to continue a price system which can distribute goods only by means of a medium of exchange technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible the greater the abundance the smaller the price in a real abundance there can be no price at all only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death the technate will encompass the entire american continent from panama to the north pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent selfsustaining geographical unit

wikipedia also says they had issues with antisemitism elons grandfather didnt become a racist when he got to south africa he was a homegrown americancanadian racist who moved to south africa as a result

if you really want to draw some kind of familiar inheritance story for elon musk this is obviously it elon hates his father he left south africa very young in part because he didnt want to serve in the apartheid army under conscription he moved to canada and was educated there and in the united states he clearly identifies more with his mother and her side of the family 

elon is as much an ethnic white north american as he is white south african the politically problematic parts of his family are on his north american side much less so his south african side and he identifies very little with south africa and very much with north america if you really want to play ethnic politics elon is your guy maybe there is a case to be made about elons heritage but if you do make that case it doesnt go back to the afrikaners

i dont understand why so many white americans are enjoying dunking on afrikaners and white south africans in general the irony is of course that even if white south africans are considered the most racist people in the world to quote steve bannon white americans are probably the second worst amongst white people and people of european heritage

wasp white americans and white south africans share the same ethnic heritage  british and dutch at their founding both societies were built by the descendents of settler colonists with substantial populations of religious extremists both peoples committed genocide engaged in slavery and created segregated apartheid societies even if you think it matters that afrikaners dismantled their segregationist state forty or fifty years after white americans did you still have to remember that south african apartheid endured in part because of the support of the united states itself you point a finger and three point back at you

rather than engage in the detailed study of bloodlines and dredging up ethnic history to figure out who is worse we should simply resolve to judge each person on their own merit elon is a deeply flawed person all on his own judge him for that

afrikaners have a history of violence and human rights violations as do almost all groups of people as of 1994 they are active participants of a flawed but rapidly consolidating liberal democracy with equal rights for all which they helped to build even during apartheid there were afrikaners who did the right thing and resisted it from sailor malan to bram fischer to breyten breytenbach to frederik van zyl slabbert and even amongst those who were less progressive their contributions to global politics are still important  jan smuts is basically the founder of the international system afrikaners bad is a braindead take for anyone who wants to make any statement about 20th century politics and its hypocritical when white americans do it in particular this applies to white south africans as a whole too theres more to them than just apartheid

for their achievements in the past their cooperation in the democratic transition and their real efforts to move beyond the injustices of the past afrikaners deserve more than to be judged on the account of a man who is literally not even an afrikaner



nb i also made one or two jokes about elon being the reincarnation of cecil  rhodes and a representative of my countrys penchant for corruption but the tone that has evolved around elons heritage makes me now regret those jokes as well lets all do better",Top_Lime1820,neoliberal,153,486,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/1ihf5qm/its_wrong_to_use_elon_to_get_away_with/

the proposals  which emerged from a special session gov gavin newsom called last year shortly after trumps election  easily passed on a partyline vote and now go to the governor for his signature

california democrats have not taken up the resistance mantle as readily as they did during trumps first term when legislative leaders took a hard line against his administration almost immediately after the 2016 election but their remarks on monday show they may be prepared to take a more combative approach a little just weeks into the presidents second term

the chambers republican minority argued its foolish to be taking on trump when california is trying to secure federal aid for the devastating los angelesarea wildfires which broke out after lawmakers called the special session

newsom who greeted the president on a southern california airport tarmac during a visit to tour the damage last month has struck a softer tone in recent weeks praising trumps past support of the state and vowing to work with him to rebuild

but in the statehouse monday assembly democrats  even those from swing districts  spoke in favor of the litigation bill they countered that its essential to protect federal dollars flowing to their constituents especially after the administrations sweeping bid last to freeze aid california and other blue states challenged the move in court and a federal judge on friday issued an order blocking the funding pause until further notice ruling it was likely unconstitutional",John3262005,neoliberal,0,64,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/03/california-trump-lawsuits-immigrant-aid-00202256

the four federally funded programs educate people in immigration courts and detention centers about their rights and the complicated legal process the justice department instructed the nonprofits on jan 22 to stop work immediately on the programs citing an executive order targeting illegal immigration that president donald trump signed the day of his second inauguration

a coalition of nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit friday challenging the stopwork order and seeking to immediately restore access to the programs the justice department rescinded its stopwork order for all four programs sunday afternoon

the nonprofit organizations which had expressed concern that the absence of the programs left people to navigate the system on their own had worried that due process rights would be violated and the backlogged immigration courts would be further bogged down

a group representing former fbi agents the society of retired special agents urged its members to call their elected officials to protest the potential punishment or firing of jan 6 case agents

2025-02-03 17:21:27,analysistrump plans to invoke obscure 18th century wartime law in bid for mass deportations,"president donald trump is set to test the limits of his immigration crackdown by invoking a wartime law to deport immigrants alleged to be gang members without court hearings a broad authority that could supercharge his mass deportation push and potentially sweep in people not charged with crimes

after taking office trump ordered military and immigration officials to be ready by feb 3 to implement the 1798 alien enemies act last used to justify internment camps for people of japanese german and italian descent during world war two the move  which would almost certainly face legal challenges  could allow him to bypass due process rights and rapidly remove migrants

even with trumps sweeping early actions his administration will have to contend with overwhelmed immigration courts where asylum cases can take years to resolve trump expanded a fasttrack deportation process known as expedited removal but it only applies to those in the us for two years or less and still gives migrants the ability to claim asylum

the alien enemies act could allow trump to rapidly deport migrants deemed part of an invasion or predatory incursion  a novel use of a law previously only invoked in wartime republicans frequently refer to illegal immigration as an invasion and portray migrants as dangerous criminals and militaryaged

the white house said on jan 20 that it was beginning a process to designate criminal cartels and gangs including the venezuelan gang tren de aragua as terrorist organizations and to use the alien enemies act to deport alleged gang members

the trump administration is pushing to ramp up detention space a move that could work in conjunction with the alien enemies act",John3262005,neoliberal,40,173,https://www.aol.com/news/analysis-trump-plans-invoke-obscure-110127154.html

2025-02-03 12:45:33,some migrants arrested in trumps immigration crackdown have been released back into us,"the trump administration aggressively publicized the arrests of more than 8000 immigrants by federal agents since inauguration day with the promise that those detained would be part of a historic mass deportation but nbc news has learned that some have already been released back into the united states on a monitoring program according to five sources familiar with the operations

arresting more people inside the united states on allegations of immigration violations means they need to be held somewhere and significant space constraints in immigration and customs enforcement detention facilities  and federal court orders forbidding indefinite detention  have forced the agency to release some of those arrested in the roundups rather than hold them until deportation 

ice posts arrest figures daily on x but it does not disclose how many of those arrested are released remain in detention or have been deported 

in a statement to nbc news an ice spokesperson acknowledged federal court cases limit ice from detaining people indefinitely if their countries refuse to take them back which can lead ice to release them 

those released are being kept on a monitoring program known as alternatives to detention the five sources familiar with the releases said which has for more than a decade been used to keep track of where migrants are as they make their way through the immigration system ice can track them by ankle monitors or wrist bands or through telephonic checkins 

trumps ban on catch and release appears to be in effect at the southern border where few migrants are being processed for asylum claims but because ice is funded for only 41500 beds nationwide it is still releasing some migrants who were detained in the interior of the country",John3262005,neoliberal,4,63,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/people-caught-trump-immigration-crackdown-released-us-rcna186360

in just the last two months the european union concluded three new trade deals by punishing longtime allies with tariffs mr trump is encouraging other nations to form trading blocs and networks that exclude the united states

the global economy is increasingly becoming one that is characterized by ever deepening trade relationships excluding the united states said jacob f kirkegaard a senior fellow in brussels at the peterson institute for international economics

the trend is not necessarily anyones preference he said but the arrangements offer a second best option given americas rejection of a more open economic order he added that the proliferation of trading blocs like the one between the european union and south american nations also helped countries avoid an overreliance on china

at the same time economic power around the globe was shifting china had emerged as an economic superpower not only does it now account for more than 30 percent of the globes manufacturing but it has also leaped ahead of the rest of the world in cheaply producing sophisticated electric vehicles batteries and solar panels

key hardliners and others on the budget panel are pushing to outline at least 1 trillion in spending cuts in the blueprint that the committee is supposed to debate this week according to three people familiar with the private discussions who were granted anonymity to describe them

that initial blueprint included more than 300 billion in spending cuts but added 325 billion in new spending for defense border security and deportation operations johnson argued republicans could add more cuts later but needed to quickly advance the budget resolution to keep the sweeping domestic policy package on track

so gop leaders late last week went back to the committees the three people said telling them to find places to cut spending beyond what the chairs presented as minimum targets at the gop retreat

for example the energy and commerce committee would need to increase its planned 200 billion minimum in cuts which almost assuredly will trigger tough conversations around medicaid the agriculture committee which had outlined a minimum target of 50 billion in cuts during the final retreat meeting would now need to cut 150 billion that would mean deeper impacts on the supplemental nutrition assistance program that helps feed more than 40 million lowincome americans

republicans are also planning to include projected gdp growth and likely revenue from president donald trumps tariffs in their plans as they try to pay for the massive bill without adding to the growing national debt  even though many house republicans doubt whether tariff revenue is a viable offset",John3262005,neoliberal,17,66,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/02/house-budget-committee-spending-cuts-00002319

2025-02-18 00:36:44,i feel like socialist movements need some level of adaptation to todays political climate in order to create actual change,"i feel like were falling behind in a way perhaps its just my own skewed view seeing how many farright governments are being propped up but i feel like theres a serious need for reflection on what we can do on how we can change our tactics something like that 

im not sure if this will be entirely accurate because its been a while since i read marx im going back to reread the manifesto and das kapital but i feel like rather than capitalism collapsing thanks to its contradictions were seeing it mutate thanks to social media the posttruth era and right wing populism its very easy for the dead horse of capitalism to be beat over and over and for people to be told that there isnt anything wrong going on at all

its become so easy to tell the populace that nothing is wrong its so easy for corporations and governments to influence what people believe and its enough to where i feel its possible to gaslight the populace into abiding by what corporations and bureaucrats want 

this makes me wonder is there something were missing i understand substantial change can happen at any time if we will it but the majority of people arent uncomfortable enough and since its possible to manipulate them into believing nothing is wrong essentially turning them frogs in a boiling pot i dont know if there ever will be such a crisis point

at that point what do we do how much faith can we put in empty protesting how much faith can we put in our old practices of organizing i feel like we need to go about things differently

i apologize if this is vague i really dont know how to articulate what i mean in the way i would like i just feel that socialist movements need to adapt in some way and we need to do things differently more actively something like that",Suitable-Figure-2730,socialism,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1irzqyz/i_feel_like_socialist_movements_need_some_level/

im reaching out to this community because i want to learn more about the actions we can take that genuinely drive change are there specific activities youve engaged in that felt truly meaningful

additionally im on the lookout for online platforms that not only allow us to engage with issues but also facilitate real tangible actions if you know any platforms where engagement translates into collective action and realworld impact could you share them

without china the amount of poor people in the world ie those living at less than about 7 a day massively increased

meanwhile last year billionaire wealth has increase  2t the collective wealth of 3k billionaires is  15t more than any country on earth besides china and the us

one has thousands of times more chances of being struck by lightning or be eaten by a shark rather than become a billionaire meritocracy is a sham and myth akin to divine right to rule used on the masses by monarchs in previous eras

they are not geniuses but thieves and nepo babies and to deflect the unfairness of their positions and privileges they claim the real enemy are immigrants or minorities in short the more it changes the more it is the same we are back in early 1800s in london at the dawn of the industrial revolution

whatever middle class ever existed in america and the western world was due to a wealth pump accumulating resources either stolen inside the americas andor colonies and concentrated enough so the crumbs of it would prevent the proletariat from being in slums but now that is falling apart and the masks are off for all to see

just like paris commune the bolchevik revolution and in an extreme case the khmer rouges which were a massive cleansing wildfire the sociopathic elites are bound to pay sooner or later for this collective misery and rightfully so and furthermore they are the ones responsible for innocent blood spilled to wipe them out the same way as a criminal pursued by authorities who kill an innocent while subduing him can charge him with said innocent murder",IanTrader,socialism,5,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1is81ev/all_of_the_people_lifted_from_poverty_since_1990/

but even just going out to pick up trash is a simple way to step outside that constant technological framework we exist within and engage with our community on a local level even if youre not necessarily meeting many new people idk im trying to figure this out more and more i want to join my local democratic socialist branch but i dont know if we really have one

i feel like with the us going to hell on the federal level its up to us to support our communities on theocal level we can no longer look for hope or change or help from the government im also curious along those lines of people think there are different political ideologies for different points in time lately ive been wondering if something more like anarchygtsocialism might be required 

ive started a podcast focusing on homelessness since i was homeless myself for 3 years and thats the thing that i hope i can help make change with i might be getting this homeless outreach job soon too but it took me a long time to get to this point addiction and shit made my existence pretty self centered for a long time i hope by sharing peoples personal stories with first hand interviews that i can spread compassion and understanding for people who are experiencing homelessness still can be a very abstract thing that is hard to measure the effects of which is why it would be nice to engage locally

we need workers and poor people to wakeup to fact that the entire state apparatus is the problem it feeds off your toil any measly concession is almost immediately outpaced by inflation rendering it useless

we cannot live or cooperate with this neoreactionary vs neoliberal shitscape we find ourselves in its a battle we have fuck all to do with yet its going to crush us the most

all im saying is reformism has to go we have to believe in our hearts that the collectives and communes are coming liberty and equality will reign supreme when the people of this world reclaim their autonomy

also unions should be pushing hard iww rhetoric fuck this shit we want the entire economy we the toilers will do as we please with our wealth and govern our own affairs

the point is to completely abolish the capitalist system to basically create a thriving society of human flourishing

2025-02-16 08:33:01,on the shunning of liberals,"i have noticed a lot of influencers namely badempaneda and darknovia calling for the left to shun liberals in the same way that we shun fascists that they are inherently part of the same issue while i definitely see their point i fear that this tendency may prove to be selfdestructive

liberalism at its core is a system that upholds and maintains capitalism imperialism and class oppression historically liberals have been more than happy to betray socialists and revolutionarieswhether it was the german social democrats crushing the spartacists roosevelt cozying up to corporate america after flirting with the new deal or the way western liberals today enable war crimes in palestine yemen and beyond

but outright shunning liberals in the same way that we reject fascists might be shortsighted unlike the farright many liberals are not fully conscious defenders of the ruling class instead theyre victims of ideological conditioning they believe in democracy human rights and progress but they fail to see how those ideals are weaponized to serve imperialism that means some liberals can be radicalized

so instead of treating them as sworn enemies it might be better to

1 expose their contradictions  push them to see how their values clash with their policies eg you support human rights then why do you back biden when he arms genocidal regimes
2 provide a real alternative  show them that socialism isnt just about being angry but actually building a world that genuinely upholds equality justice and peace
3 distinguish between naive liberals and rulingclass liberals  the workingclass liberal can be reasoned with the corporate ngobacked or political elite liberals are enemies

the farright wants us to shun liberals completely because it helps drive them into reaction if we refuse to engage with them theyll either stay in their bubble or drift toward the right but if we meet them where they are and push them leftward we weaken liberalism and build socialist consciousness at the same time",SupremeSoviet1917,socialism,55,381,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iqnwfs/on_the_shunning_of_liberals/

2025-02-15 20:28:23,just saying,"the bottom 50 of americans own almost nothing that hasnt changed since the 19th century

meanwhile the top 10 now control nearly 50 of all wealth

and yet were still told to just work harder

if generational wealth was really going to spread naturally we would have seen it happen by now but we haventbecause this system is designed to hoard wealth at the top while keeping the rest of us fighting for scraps

the top 1 have seen their wealth skyrocket since the 1980s while wages for the working class have barely moved

the idea that everyone just needs to pull themselves up is a mythbecause how can you pull yourself up when you have nothing to start with

when you own nothing you have to accept everything
any wage any job conditions any rent price because you have no leverage
the rich dont just own wealththey own choices

and this is why redistribution isnt about handoutsits about power if you have a small property a basic income or an inheritance suddenly you have choices you can refuse jobs that exploit you you can start a business you can buy a home you dont have to accept survival wages just to get by

ive worked warehouse jobs ive been one of the top order pullers at gerson in a single shift i could personally move 70000 worth of product out the door that warehouse alone makes close to a million dollars a day

and yet workers barely see a fraction of that wealth

the richest corporations are pulling in recordbreaking profits yet wages havent budged

they could pay us more they could offer better conditions they just dont
this isnt about economics its about control because when you have nothing you cant afford to say no

a fair system is one that guarantees
 universal access to basic needseducation healthcare housing retirement
 a minimum inheritance for alljust like in france where a proposed 120000 or 180000 in the us would be given to every adult at 25
 progressive wealth taxesensuring billionaires pay their fair share to fund public services

if you think this is radical ask yourselfwhy is it normal for billionaires to hoard money theyll never use while millions struggle to survive

i keep hearing that this isnt something city council can fix maybe they cant fix everything but lets be realthey control more than you think

olathe pd chooses who gets locked up who gets fined and who gets ignored

local zoning laws decide who can afford housing and who gets pushed out

city budgets prioritize where taxpayer money goespolicing or social services infrastructure or corporate tax breaks
dont let them tell you theyre powerless they choose their priorities every day the question iswho are they prioritizing

the facts are there the numbers dont lie
expose the truth bring these numbers to light make people uncomfortable with reality
fight for policy change demand livable wages labor protections and corporate accountability

2025-02-15 18:14:05,coming off antidepressants makes me realise why so many people in society are on them,"since recently coming off my antidepressant which i was on for six years ive been more outraged at the ridiculousness of capitalism and its impact on society more than ever

i live in the uk where our most of our public utilities are owned by pension funds and  foreign sovereign wealth funds eg water companies have a complete geographic monopoly so for london thames water is your only choice and its majority shareholder is canadian they just profit off us dont invest in infrastructure and pump shit into our rivers and we just go on with our lives like thats a normal fucking thing and makes sense

if you talk about taking stuff back into public ownership you are hit with we cant afford it i didnt say buy it i said take it the markets wont like that  oh yes the democratically elected markets who control our economies to ensure we are playing ball with their neoliberal rulebook what a surprise they wont like it how can you not go mad in a world that is so illogical

obviously i have always been aware of this stuff but the anger and hopelessness of living in a crooked society filled with rampant inequality where the fat cats carry on getting exponentially bigger is overwhelming

who wouldnt want some soma to survive in this society odd that 15 of the population all need medication to get by  surely we should look at some root causes  capitalism is undoubtedly massive contributor to anxiety depression and nihilism

edit this post is not in anyway an encouragement for anyone to come off antidepressants or to demonise them it was merely an insight into capitalisms role in the mental health epidemic there is definitely some merit to this and there is books on the topic eg sedated by james davies however this does not mean people should not use antidepressants which have helped so many people including myself please always consult your doctor before making any medical related decisions",MaltoseMaltase,socialism,36,125,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iq7fzv/coming_off_antidepressants_makes_me_realise_why/

so i run an education and community outreach club that has a focus on advocating for activism and anticapitalism education i wont disclose the name of the club but socialism is in the name and were based in the northeastern us

as part of our community outreach side of our mission we fundraise for a charity of choice semesterly with baked goods we sell everything for a dollar and all the funds go a charity

historically we donated to the palestinian childrens relief fund last semester we tried something different and donated directly to a family on a go fund me this was because of conserns of the money not making it to the palestinian children

that brings me to this semester on the 14th were doing it again but no one has settled on who to donate to i would like to donate to someone established such as an organization like pcrf this is because of our student governement budget office having strict rules and may have to donate to someone established to make the process easier however i would also like other options in mind such as go fund mes where we know itll go directly to someone

the left has grown why well besides their own organizing efforts their own motion we have to understand the role of the democratic party in modern america as a role of false leftism and anti racism used to coopt the energy of mass movements when this energy is coopted the democratic party is almost like a false left vanguard that constantly rallies around this energy to win their elections against the republicans outcry against racism and the far right has been heavily utilized by democrats long before trump not only would then go on to wage the same policies as the republicans and gaslight people about it but they would support the same policies as the republicans when they were holding power in office an example would be how many voted for the iraq war but utilized peoples mass protest against it to get energy for elections 

over the years this illusion has been getting destroyed the veil has been lifting back and the democrats can no longer serve this role with the impactfulness they once had this creates a vacuum where other forms of organizing begins to be looked towards as alternatives the true left the american democratic party can no longer play this role of social control so they are becoming overtly aligned with the fascism that serves the class interests that drives their party even the more liberal progressive groups are now butting heads with the democrats the push pull gaslighting method of elections doesnt work like it once did in america",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,7,213,https://youtu.be/NS-N8I7EvSw?si=1eZzqZwUhF4XYvZK

 im hoping the community can give me some advice on how to help a younger member of my family they are active on social media so lll keep this vague for privacy 

to start this is a really smart kid they are obsessed with philosophy history specifically ww2 and will read all day if you let them there is nothing wrong with knowing youre smart but teenager confidence leads them to believe they are the smartest person in the room and that causes them to speak about philosophers and politics in a condescending armchair intellectual kind of way we live in the deep south so a lot of his obscure pseudo intellectual talking points go over the familys head and they miss the dog whistles lve been hearing out of this kids mouth

for a while now they have been talking about how much they
admire the nazis strategies and tactics seeing the writing on the wall lve asked them to give me recommendations on youtube channels they watch two of them being shoeonhead and whatifalhist im not an expert on these youtubers but from what lve seen they add more to my anxiety about the direction this kid is going in

if anyone has advice on how to help direct their passion for learning towards antinazi sentiment and more progressive ideas ld be very grateful this is a good kid with a lot of strengths and kindness and i dont want to see it corroded by hateful rhetoric",CuriousHo3Down72,socialism,10,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iox0ul/family_member_falling_down_the_alt_right_pipeline/

but the thing i cannot stand is the fact that i cannot use my voice or work towards political causes a weather woman in our local market just got fired for speaking out against the elon nazi salute on her private social media for crying out loud also i definitely have to write things that uphold capitalism i do get to inject a little progressive thought in there but not too much

ive been looking into trades great pay unionized and i get to work with my hands which i think will be a bit of a mental relief that i need but trades careers do seem like a huge time commitment with lots of overtime which is used to compensate for the fact that many jobs do not have pto also a huge project in my area is a microsoft facility ew and other builds appear to be slew of crappy unneeded mixed use apartment buildings when we have plenty of old unused housing

i know theres no conscientious consumption under capitalism and therefore i believe that extends to no conscientious jobs under capitalism but the thought of working on buildings that i hate doesnt excite me ideally id work my way up to being able to be more choosy with jobs but given i do like a decent work life balance and might not accept overtime as much as others might hurt my chances also im a woman so im guessing ill have to work twice as hard to get what i want

are there other jobs out there that im not thinking of am i just being a big baby and need to bite the bullet work my ass off to ruin parts of my city for the next decade and then maybe i can have some freedom to do things im actually passionate about",MammaCat22,socialism,21,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iotkm0/socialist_with_adhd_and_no_clue_where_to_go_with/

2025-02-13 19:49:06,ai will accelerateforce socialism,"ive thought this for a while and pls give me a chance to explain just to start im not a crypto bro by any means

for several reasons it feels some leftists take an antitech stance nuclear power is a big example where even though it is a finite resource that creates waste the payout is more than worth it at the same time we 100 should make our foundation sustainable energy 

under capitalism i can agree there is lots of pointless innovation that exists purely to be sold and make profit such as a million different phones and pointless gadgets capitalism also perverts lots of technology and uses it to exploit people such as social media and surveillance

at the same time its really confusing seeing how antiai many leftists are i can understand the argument that it consumes lots of energy doing things humans can do themselves and that search engines are already capable of my response to that is that the cost to run these models significantly drops over time these models are not forever expensive to run were already seeing the cost to run them drop significantly as they are open sourced and refined plus the payoff is 100 worth the cost even now millions around the world have already benefited from its existence and use it daily while they are wrong about lots of things sometimes this is the very first iphone version as they perfect the technology the cost goes down and its ability skill and knowledge goes up were already seeing them rapidly become the best programmers on earth

another argument thats made is that ai art steals from artists which makes no sense at all to me all art is inspired by other art thats kinda the whole point humans steal and build on each others art all the time and theres no issue when a human does it art is similar to science where people release their work for others to use and build on considering leftists are anti private property i would expect us to also be anti intellectual property you cant own an idea technology or art the second you release it you forfeit any money you wouldve made selling it what artists should really be upset about is the fact they depend on making art for survival because of capitalism which brings me to my next point

another argument is that they will cause mass layoffs which is the meat of my argument for one we have to ask why is that a bad thing the only reason mass layoffs are bad is because under capitalism people depend on their job to survive without a job you starve but thats not a technology issue thats a political issue if something can do a job for cheaper and more efficiently theres no reason not to use it under socialism this technology would free people to focus on other important things than working a job but under capitalism its used to save money on labor and further increase profit the same argument goes for artists ai doesnt prevent a single artist from creating art the logic of capitalism does ai art enables millions of people without skills to also create their own vision and again the quality of the art is beside the point because these are the very first versions and they will rapidly improve i literally just saw an 11 minute fully ai generated star wars film this was physically impossible just last year i wouldnt be surprised if the majority of media in the future is ai generated

but even bigger than that this was always the inevitable outcome of technology it all started when we made the first tool that freed time for others things from rocks to tools to factories to robots to ai we naturally create things to do the things we dont want to do what these ai companies are attempting to create is a fully digital worker a fully digital worker can be scaled up infinitely your only restraint is physical compute an army of digital workers can be tasked with anything automated research automated labor use your imagination a socialist implementation of these technologies could revolutionize the world if we had an entirely automated economy we could meet everyones needs globally for little cost we could guarantee everyone a high standard of living we could fully separate work from access to resources because the ai handles it all

now how ai will accelerate the transition to socialism imo is this we will start seeing mass layoffs in the near future due to ai and robotics no one can deny it atp when that happens most people will be moving towards poverty as they spend their last dollars trying to survive many people will fight over the last remaining jobs and resentment will start to build once billionaires fully employ ai and robots and while the majority of the population is unemployed people wont just sit and starve liberals are already advocating for ubi and similar programs but we as socialists have to take it one step further getting handouts from billionaires isnt enough we have to seize the robots and ai for ourselves only then can we have true freedom and liberation i believe the contradictions of capitalism would be too blatant to ignore people will see themselves and their families hungry while the rich profit off ai the argument that they worked hard for it would no longer be realistic because ai does all the work once people have no other choice besides revolution to feed their families thats what will happen

tldr robots and ai will lead to mass unemployment with a massively unemploymed population people will have no other choice but to seize the means of production for themselves liberals are already advocating for halfway socialism with ubi and similar programs because people will have no other way to feed themselves but we have to take it further",gg0idi0h0f,socialism,29,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iorru8/ai_will_accelerateforce_socialism/

i feel like im losing when all i see is people talking about how all these people coming over are ruining the country but how isnt it obvious that most of the major issues we face now are just the result of so many of our governments selling off all public utilities abysmal investment into any public infrastructure besides more roads and a complete disregard for basic economics

why are a small number of people making a massive profit off of the bare necessities that we all need to exist its unbearable to me that theres a small number of people essentially draining all the money out of our pockets just so we can turn on on the taps or have a roof over our heads or turn on the lights and worst of all just so we can eat

how can so many politicians sit back and watch as everyone is being pushed into destitution

supermarkets are making massive profits year on year and yet prices have yet to fall

how can i participate in this economy if all my disposable income is just used to simply exist i have to live frugally just to get by and i cant imagine thats gonna change all that much as life carries on ill hopefully get a decent paying job from my degreesoftware engineering but yet again im gonna be bankrupted by rent costs travel costs paying back my uni loan for the rest of my life amongst other taxes and payments i have to make just to live",Frosty-Meet6245,socialism,30,203,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iofsuk/living_in_the_the_uk_feels_like_a_game_of/

2025-02-11 16:16:53,how would an egoist someone only interested in their immediate personal wellbeing be convinced to transition to socialism,"lets imagine someone who is completely motivated by individualism theyll only do something if it benefits them in the shortterm and ethics have no sway on them

this is the kind of person who if they didnt have kids would vote to shut down every public school right now if that same money could be used to reduce their personal food prices for example

this is the kind of person who doesnt care about climate change because they live in a location that didnt suffer negative consequences from it in the shortterm

this is the kind of person who doesnt feel fundamentally alienated or depressed by working under capitalism theyre happy enough that the efforts of transitioning to socialism they make enough money they dont mind ads and consumerism and the uncertainty involved in transition would likely appear to be a downgrade to their quality of life

this is the kind of person who doesnt trust democracy because plenty of people dont vote for whats best for them anyway so the idea of a democratic economy doesnt appeal to them

this is the kind of person who acknowledges that lots of people already disagree with them so the idea of voting against the grain doesnt turn them off

this is the kind of person who is happy to talk politics with friends and family but doesnt care when everyone calls them an ahole because hey what incentive do they have to be nice to others right now instead of doing whats best for them right now

this person has friends anyway because likeminded individualists exist in the world and this person is generally a good friend because they care about their friends they just have no regard for the larger world as such they are swayed by whats good for their friends but not swayed by friends arguments that xyz would be good for the larger world theyd vote to keep education if their friends had kids but not if their friends would disown them because other people in the world have kids they would merely see those friends as going against their own best interests

this is the kind of person with no sense of ethics or morality beyond i do whats best for me right now



i know this kind of person exists on paper i see no way to convince someone like that that socialism is appealing

my background in adult education tells me that this person is at a very low level of moral maturity this suggests that the solution is for society to nurture moral education and evolve people to more nuanced sophisticated ethical identities  in other words the solution may be to say that this person needs an ethical education at which point they would desire socialism

my concern with that strategy is that this person may fight back argue indoctrination and feel like theyre being told that they cant be who they are and that they have to change because of some social agenda they may argue that socialism is just begging the question in a way  of course if we convince people to have higher morals theyll see socialism appealing but what about the here and now where plenty of people are just not swayed by ethics and are content enough theyll never support it

im trying to find a way to argue that socialism is appealing regardless of who you are

paulo freire and marx talk about alienation and dehumanization as major driving forces for a universal appeal of socialism but it doesnt seem like this person feels particularly alienated or dehumanized

i want to of course argue that they are in fact feeling many negative effects of capitalism and that the transition is worth it but thats a tough sell for someone like this

there must be a way to appeal to the most selfishegotistical ahole out there and build an argue that socialism is good for them but i cant find it every strategy i see comes back to class consciousness agapism disinterested love for others or falling quality of life and  or widescale destruction

the only other argument i can think of is a logical one capitalism isnt sustainable socialism is there theres a rational reason to change

but again this person is going to say yeah but transitions are hard and scary and not worth it to me im gonna pull a nimby and make that someone elses struggle

the way forward in my mind is to build a stronger sense of ethics into the population or let capitalism destroy lives so badly that even the most egotistical megalomaniac would revolt and demand socialism 

but again this person would say who are you to tell me what ethics to live by go away theyll be turned off by all of that so how do we reach someone like that 

again my education tells me that the solution is time society needs time to build the sophisticated understanding required for socialism and this person is just a particularly slow hiker

how do we prevent that kind of person from being a barrier to humanitys progress

2025-02-11 00:30:52,comparing trumps policy shifts amp gorbachevs reforms,"gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika to reform the soviet system these policies inadvertently eroded the ideological and institutional foundations of the ussr accelerating its collapse his policies of liberalization unleashed an economic chaos that the soviet system was not able to contain

today trump is pursuing a similar if ideologically inverted disruption of the us institutions attacking the deep state undermining trust in media and elections and prioritizing loyalty over expertise hes enacting a purge of the permanent bureaucracy under the guise of draining the swamp feeding off polarization and institutional distrust these policies erode the very stability of the system paving the way to an unravelling akin to that of the ussr

gorbachev inherited a stagnant economy that he attempted to fix using market reforms with perestroika these reforms took form of a shock therapy with sudden price liberalization fiscal austerity and privatization an economic collapse followed as a result of hyperinflation economic instability and the rise of an oligarchic class similarly trump is busy slashing regulations and cutting corporate taxes fuelling shortterm growth that deepens wealth inequality and corporate consolidation like gorbachev hes ushering in a polarized economic landscape where faith in the system is rapidly dwindling among the public

the economic unravelling of ussr revived nationalist movements particularly in the baltics and ukraine that undermined the unifying ideology similarly amplified nationalism in form of maga is deepening cultural and regional divides in the us trumps rhetoric is rooted in divisive politics just as soviet republics turned inward postglasnost prioritizing local grievances over collective unity so are states like texas florida and california are increasingly talking about breaking with the union

gorbachevs reforms set the stage for yeltsin who presided over the chaotic privatization of state assets enabling a handful of oligarchs to seize control of russias oil gas and media empires the shock therapy transition to capitalism led to a rapid rise of the kleptocrats similarly musks companies target the remaining public services and industries for privatization spacex aims to replace nasa teslaboring co are going after infrastructure while x is hijacking public discourse in this way his wealth and influence mirror yeltsinera oligarchs grip on strategic sectors the main difference here is that musk operates in a globalized capitalist system as opposed to the postsoviet fire sale musk is actively using his platform and wealth to shape politics in his favor and much like russian oligarchs he consistently prioritizes personal whims over systemic stability

yeltsin was sold as a democratic reformer but enabled a predatory elite many russians initially saw capitalism as liberation only to face a decade of despair as the reality of the system set in similarly musk markets himself as a visionary genius saving humanity with his vanity projects like mars colonization yet his ventures depend on public subsidies and exploitation of labor the cult of the technooligarch distracts from the consolidation of power in private hands in a yeltsinesque baitandswitch

the ussr collapsed abruptly while the us might face a slower erosion of its institutional norms yet both trump and gorbachev despite opposing goals represent disruptive forces that undermine the system through ideological gambles much as gorbachev and yeltsin did in their time trumps normbreaking and musks oligarchic power are entrenching a new era of unaccountable elites

2025-02-10 07:12:01,the philly police visited an anarchist space asking them not to hold a speaking event they didnt listen,"this happened after trumps previous victory against clinton heres what occurred the day of the event 

cops had been waiting outside the store as early as 900 am but later on it looked like they were everywhere blocks deep in either direction out in large numbers standing on corners hanging around in all shapes and sizes of police vehicles walking up and down the block circling in packs of bicycle units counter terrorism trucks were parked at 7th and bainbridge and were positioned with more police cars on the same corner

an attendee left the bookstore and was followed by two police officers into a coffee shop who monitored their activity and tailed them for blocks more and more cops showed up lining the street while filming and photographing everyone who entered or left the shop

concerned at the large and hostile police presence some people who wished to come to the talk thought it better to leave the police seemed to be about to do something in fact they already had the day before two police officers entered the shoe and asked that they cancel the event the police made nonsense claims that they feared the presence of antifascists would result in street conflict and made accusations about antifas involvement with recent protest actions

we want to reiterate philadelphia police tried to stop this event

they were trying to shut down a free opentothepublic speaking engagement about antifascism with author and political scholar matthew lyons lyons went on anyway and spoke to a standing room only crowd regarding his most recent work ctrlaltdelete antifascist report on the alternative right so many people turned up for the talk we ran out of room and those who could fit inside got to learn about the rising tide of altright ideology and fascist activity we hope that the cops watching and filming us through the windows enjoyed the talk as well they obviously have an intense interest in fascism

this behavior should sound the alarm the state is poised to crack down on communities simply based on political ideology radical spaces groups and associations are being targeted philly antifa and antifascists everywhere are being threatened we will not accept a world in which it is possible to silence a public talk at a bookstore we must work together now to resist this blatant repression

at this point we cant trust the same structures that allowed conditions to reach this point to fix them the people of providence need to demand that our schools are under truly local control and prioritize providing a quality education and safe environment to students and faculty

a lot of people where i live think its intellectually superior to just describe themselves as a moderate because they dislike both parties and think that being a moderateapolitical is the only way to escape the two party system theyre not really aware that the political spectrum of the us is mostly right leaning even liberals 

i met my boyfriend 21m last year and i thought he was a lot more left leaning than he actually is because he is agnosticatheist said that if he could vote in the 2020 and 2016 elections he would have voted blue but for last year he was unsure because he thought that both parties were both terrible at the time i assumed he meant that because both parties were zionists but now im not really sure what he meant he also watches hasan sometimes who i dont really watch anymore but i agree with a lot of his views on current topics so i thought he was left leaning 

it turns out he doesnt like either party and describes himself as a moderate but i really think thats just because he doesnt realize that other options exist i dont even think he really understands what i believe politically because it seems like he thinks people can only be republican democrat or moderate he also didnt vote last year i was thinking of showing him youtube videos by second thought because thats what helped me become more left leaning but im really unsure

despite that ive come to call myself a socialist or at least a nonspecified leftist part of the reason is that i just fall in the target demographic im queer from a poor family part roma atheist basically no other ideology would accept me with such ease ive also have studied a fair but not impressive amount of marxist theory and i also attend american studies faculty so i learned a fair bit about disastrous effects of the neoliberal policies and their imperialism

despite all that i have to admit  i dont feel like a real socialist theres some concepts i just cant figure out how are supposed to be superior  like abolishment of currency doing away with borders police dissolution im yet to understand why im supposed to be respectful of ussr and communist china rather than seeing them as evil empires ive also have some trouble connecting with certain social justice causes this may be a cancelable offense but i sometimes think about a high percentage of crimes committed by minorities including my fellow roma and think poverty doesnt justify all of it if they could control themselves better they situation might get better im also despite being gay sometimes embarrassed when i see public displays of queerness to the point of being annoying to other people i fail to see how kink community can help me get gay marriage in my country i dont know why so many lgbt insist on normalizing sex to an unthinkable for me degree like public nudity and swingers clubs

i say all of this not to hear scolding or consolations though i dont mind either im asking where can i identify this problem do i just need to watch more leftist video essays until it gets stuck in my brain would reading more marxist theory help or is it a deeper problem am i simply apathethic and hateful brainwashed by my conservative country unable to shed instilled bigotry

the 50 ruling thursday noted that contompasis who often goes by his first two names had failed to prove his use of a knife to stab one person and attempt to stab another was justified selfdefense proud boy dominic wierzbicki started a fight that resulted in his brother james p warner and local proud boy chapter leader douglas michael ruso being stabbed wierzbicki turned himself into police in march 2021 and was charged with thirddegree assault and possession of a weapon in the fourthdegree these charges ultimately resulted only in wierzbicki being fined

the ruling claimed that video contradicted contompasis contention that he had rushed to the aid of a friend who was being roughed up and was nearly knocked out by the first stabbing victim causing contompasis to swing his knife wildly in an effort to protect himself

while the ruling also noted the panel took letters of support from community and the one misdemeanor on stokes criminal record into consideration when making their decision it largely depended on contompasis social media posts which they claimed lacked remorse

the family said they are planning to appeal to the new york state court appeals

heartbroken doesnt begin to cover how we feel a post on instagram reads i want to thank everyone for your support its not easy to speak truth to power but this community has given me the strength and courage to keep going i meant it when i said this account was created as an act of love as long as alex is away and even when he gets back ill be doing my part to help people trapped in this abusive and draconian carceral system

he literally said i would classify violence as the destruction of property and vandalism the shouting of insulting messages to the police physical confrontations with the police those are very clear cut acts of violence shouting at police  an anarchist responded to this with chris hedges as much as i admire his critiques and commitment to liberation work he has this tendency of reactionary rhetoric 


he also was wrong to continuously refer to anarchists as the black bloc movement its not a movement its a tactic and it was created by german marxists its a broad tactic whats even more confusing is hedges appears to have supported such tactics when they happen outside of america chris hedges wrote this about greek anarchists 

they know what to do when they are told their pensions benefits and jobs have to be cut to pay corporate banks which screwed them in the first place call a general strike riot shut down the city centers toss the bastards out do not be afraid of the language of class warfarethe rich versus the poor the oligarchs versus the citizens the capitalists versus the proletariat the greeks unlike most of us get it




yet when people do way lighter more defensive versions of that in america he calls it a cancer i dont get the open inconsistency is it perhaps his position and career as a journalist puts him in a position where it must be denounced in north america im not sure i fully understand",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,17,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1il0ifo/chris_hedges_holds_reactionary_sentiment/

it doesnt have to be straightforwardly leftist although things like disco elysium are always welcome of course but at least just devoid of liberal centrist bullshit the more i started to analyze media i consume the more i realize just how much i have been brainwashed all my life so i am both repulsed by those liberal rhetorics quietly sneaked in and concerned with how much of it i subconsciously take in again like i cannot treat arcane seriously anymore despite originally enjoying it because of how painfully centrist it is

2025-02-07 05:59:31,every socialist should read abolish rent the american left will die without a strong national tenants movement,"from two cofounders of the largest tenants union in the country this deeply reported account of the resurgent tenant movement centers poor and workingclass people who are fighting back staying put and remaking the city in the process authors tracy rosenthal and leonardo vilchis take us to trilingual strategy meetings raucous marches against gentrification and daring eviction defenses where immigrants put their lives on the line these are the seeds of the revolutionary movement we need to make our housing our cities and the world our home

here is a link to buy the book for 50 off from haymarket 


every day the conditions for tenant organizing become more favorable the housing crisis worsens and the tenant class grows we now have a landlordinchief as the empire weakens real estate profiteering must increase to satiate the ruling class driving deeper immiseration of tenants we need a union at work and a union at home 

if you want your community to be organized and prepared as possible for whatever lies ahead you need a tenant organization if theres already a tenant organization in your community join it they probably need the help

if there isnt start one dont worry about doing everything perfectly just start learning build a social media presence and start canvassing your building or the buildings of your worst local slumlord your first time canvassing might be shitty and thats fine youll learn a lot very quickly we started our citys tenant organization about 8 months ago and we still feel like we dont know shit but at least were finally putting theory into practice 

reach out to tenant organizations in your state or neighboring states they will be excited to meet you and share advice along the way start checking out organizations like the recently formed tenant union federation and the older autonomous tenants union network

2025-02-06 16:09:20,advice for reading das kapital,"hi all so reading capital is like reading the bible for christians its an important thing to do but not many actually do it 

so i thought id offer some advice feel free to disagree but here are my suggestions

you could probably fill a library with insightful reviews responses commentary and reflections on marxs capital and many of the reviews on this site do add colour to the illustrious picture however since i dont feel that i would be able to add much i wont waste anybodys time trying to add my own views or commentary 

instead ill offer brief pointers on reading capital

read the book obvious i know but if youre like me youve probably expended a great deal of energy reading everything but the book itself as a kind of countertransference to escape getting the book read 

be wary of guidebooks its more important  to read capital on your own terms without focusing on somebodys elses perspective and all of the digressions involved in that

engage with the text scribble on it make notes highlight it put sticky notes on it underline sections take notes etc dont simply scan it passively like a newspaper article remember this is one of the most important and influential texts in the social science canon regardless of your individual view on its contents and style

acquaint yourself with some of the context of marxs work maybe read an overview of political economy before and during marxs time to understand who adam smith and the physiocrats were have a look at the poor laws the upheavals of the 1800s and try to find out why marx was reading hegel as a student dont distract yourself by trying to get an expansive view of everything around marxs life and context but a brief read on marxism like isaiah berlins karl marx  his life and environment may be helpful or lenins short portrait of marx  

break the book up into chunks read it in chapters or 1050 page bits a day its nothing doing this will help you understand the book a lot better 

read the book 

if you cant read the full version read one of the abridged versions eg gareth stedman jones abridgement or david mclellans

2025-02-05 23:57:44,donald trump is one of the most zionist presidents of all time dont let the maga cult fool you or your family,"while it is probably irrelevant to bring up the altright in 2025 it can not be denied that trumps political ascendance in 20152017 was inextricably bound up with it at least in the mainstream mass media which gave trump essentially infinite free publicity for ratings a major component of the altright amp socalled altlite in 20152018 or so was the counterjihad movement which is almost exclusively controlled by zionists one can criticize islam obviously but counterjihad is largely not really about criticizing islam as a religion but using a hyperaggressive criticism of not only muslims but virtually all arab culture as a vehicle to shill neoconservative andor zionist talking points to defend american imperialism and israeli settlercolonialism 

one major force in the counterjihad movement is daniel pipes who is the son of a man named richard pipes the elder pipes was handpicked by george hw bush to head team b a group created by bush to challenge prodetente positions within the cia by scrutinizing legitimate reports that the soviets were not a major nuclear threat and publishing disinformation cooked up in think tanks full of feds and corporate elites like the committee on the president danger cpd the american security council asc and the american enterprise institute aei this network of disinfopsywar specialists was associated with another network of think tanks and ngos which formed an early wave of what is today known as the israel lobby or zionist lobby in washington dc these include the jewish institute for national security affairs jinsa which as ed hermann writes in the terrorism industry was full of reagan administration officials as well as members of the committee on the present danger and committee for a democratic majority the latter of which was more or less the democratic party branch of the cpd started by senator henry scoop jackson whose congressional office was like a bootcamp for many of the most influential neoconservatives of the last 30 years

at this time donald j trump was following in his fathers footsteps in becoming a major friend of israel  befriended roy cohn a lawyer for the national crime syndicate as well as the american intelligence community who rose to prominence as an ally of j edgar hoover and joseph mccarthy during the second red scare following world war 2 cohn was honored in 1983 by the antidefamation league adl amp bnai brith a jewish fraternal lodge that technically predates the zionist movement but became one of its most ardent supporters not long after theodore herzl birthed it cohn was also a part of the jewish league against communism which emphatically stated that zionism and communism are incompatible and worked hard to help what is considered the modern israeli rightwing usurp power from the labor zionist coalition that controlled israels government

trump and cohn became thick as thieves cohn would use his connections in government and the mafia to garner massive tax abatements zoning variances and mobcontrolled concrete work without which trumps grand hyatt hotel trump plaza and trump tower projects never would have been possiblecohn would advise trump in every aspect of his life business and personal for years they would talk on the phone up to five times a day cohn introduced trump to another good friend of his rupert murdoch who as he was becoming a member of the american power elite used his sway over mass media to help make the trump brand into what it is today

in the the late 1980s trump met another of his best friends of all time through these same circles who happened to be another member of not only the american elite but the zionist lobby named jeffrey epstein who got his start as an investment banker managing the portfolio of edgar bronfman sr a member of the criminal bronfman wealth dynasty and a the president of the world jewish congress one of the predominant international supporters of israel not long after befriending trump epstein joined his mentor les wexner and his former client edgar bronfman as well as robert maxwell the father of his literal partnerincrime ghislaine maxwell at the mega group on of the biggest zionist lobby organizations of the 1990s and early 2000s

to return to daniel pipes and the counterjihad movement pipes started a think tank in the early 2000s called the middleeast forum mef which became one of the founding nodes of a new neoconservativeultrazionist network that included the freedom center fc the center for security policy csp and the gatestone institue gi founded by nina rosenwald there is hardly a single major proisrael organization that does not provide rosenwald with a seat on its board of directors  fc was founded by david horowitz a friend of epsteins pal alan dershowitz and a major supporter of trump csp was started by frank gaffney the top aide of richard perle during the reagan administration perle is a descendant of scoop jacksons office and a member of the project for a new american century the most wellknown neocon think tank which gained infamy for calling for a catalyzing event and a new pearl harbor to justify expanding military spending and invading iraq before 911 happened gaffney set up a group he called team b 2 during the first trump campaign all of these think tanks worked directly with the mercer foundation owned by major trump patrons robert mercer and his daughter rebekah mercer

in 2018 rosenwalds gatestone institute was led by john bolton yet another major neocon that same year ezra levants rebel media partnered with gi to produce antimuslim propaganda  media company which soon became a pillar in the altright despite its leader being both jewish and an open zionist hosted several figures who were also supporters of israel including faith goldy i am on the record in favor of a onestate solution i love israel sebastian gorka who later joined the trump administration gorka has been referred to as a true friend of israel and the jewish people by journalist sarah n stern an ardent zionist as well as the staunchest friend of israel and the jewish people by israel allies caucus cochair trent franks and tommy robinson who received 60000 from daniel pipes and thousands more from an israeliamerican billionaire named richard shillman yes thats his real last name shillman who donated over a quarter of a million dollars to trump in 2020 sits on the boards of two of david horowitzs organizations and funded project veritas when george w bush visited israel in 2008 he personally asked for shillman to escort him through the zionist settlercolony

steve bannonwho describes himself as a christian zionist when accused of antisemitism by liberals in 2016 defended by a plethora of israelis as well as american neocons including david horowitz yossi dagan an israeli politician also rushed to bannons defense another major ally of trumps tech capitalist peter thiel is like bannon an elitist friend of israel who calls himself antiestablishment thiel was supported by irving and bill kristol the father and son neocons as far back as his days at stanford university in 1987 and has repeatedly appeared alongside bill kristol at speaking events thiel is also a major investor in an israeli surveillance company founded by amir elichai a former israeli army officer who served in different positions in the special elite forces and the intelligence corps an early board member of this company dubbed carbyne was pinhas buchris a former leader of  unit 8200 a special military intelligence unit in israel unit 8200 has a special relationship with silicon valley where similar to the cias inqtel it funds thousands of tech startups and contributes innumerable members of staff to american tech companies every year 

jared kushner trumps soninlaw is part of a family that has historically been close not only to the trumps but also to the netanyahus and israel in general kushner has suggested gazas waterfront property could be very valuable  kushner foundation has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to chabad lubavitch a doomsday cult masquerading as a jewish civil society organization controlled by one of the only groups of hasidic jews to be overwhelmingly supporting of israel rather than either critically supportive or outright hostile to its existence chabad lubavitch are major supporters of trump and seem to be an agent of israeli soft power that operates across the world even in countries at war with each other including usa russia and ukraine

before trump was even swornin the first time his decision to pick mike pence as his running mate raised some eyebrows among the altright while pence seems to be a good fit for trump considering he holds one of the most socially conservative voting records in recent congressional history he is also a hardline zionist and unapologetic neocon who seemed to contradict some of trumps rhetorical gestures toward antiinterventionism on the campaign trail in 2003 pence a major ally of bush jr in the house of representatives voted for the resolution authorizing the iraq war  in 2014 pence visited the zionist settlercolony and in 2016 made it illegal for his homestate of indiana to make deals with companies that boycott the israeli occupation of palestine in 2015 pence told the republican jewish coalition israels enemies are our enemies israels cause is our cause if this world knows nothing else let it know this america stands with israel

during his first administration trump gave the neocons virtually everything they wanted regarding israel in 2018 trump officially recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel and opened a new us embassy there as vox reported trump did this in the middle of protests organized by palestinians at the israeli border with gaza the embassy opening also comes right before what palestinians call nakba day or the day of catastrophe where palestinians commemorate lands they either fled or were evicted from after the creation of the state of israel ramadan the muslim holy month also begins this week

all of this was likely the result of israels interference in the 2016 presidential election which was blamed on russia in exchange trump gave all of these zionistneocon forces a return on their investment in him",ManOvercomingHimself,socialism,0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iiovrb/donald_trump_is_one_of_the_most_zionist/

there are clear signs that the public is nearing a breaking point
		the widespread sympathy for luigi mangione he has become a modernday folk hero a symbol of rage against corporate greed many dont just understand why he did itthey view it as justified
		the gamestop short squeeze wasnt just about money millions of retail investors held their shares not to profit but to burn citadel and expose wall streets corruption it was an act of defiance
		unionization is surging amazon starbucks boeing and others are seeing unprecedented worker strikes and union drives a clear sign that people are done accepting scraps
		elon musk jeff bezos and mark zuckerberg have become villains and not just to the leftresentment against these men is increasingly bipartisan

the system that protects billionaires at the expense of the people is fragile once the illusion of fairness collapses history tells us what happens next

the question isnt if the backlash is coming its when

2025-02-06 05:11:27,in the coming months,"you all are about to hear many voices whether in the media online or in person these voices will be amplified by coin counter insurgency actors as a strategy i say amplified because these voices wont simply just be from infiltrators or feds but theyll be an organic result of individuals being restrained by preexisting petite bourgeois perspectives that favor things like respectibility and civility towards political opposition an example of this was videos of young youth yelling fuck this place fuck trump and all types of profanity and the comments are flooded with this wont help but hurt the movement or real niceface tattoos masks stealing cars aggressive music yeah this wont appeal to everyone keep the spray paint masks and bad attitudes at home hurting the movement 

this sentiment is nothing new its not just sentiment though its a piece of a larger puzzle that puzzle is the overall coin strategy utilized to pacify movements by keeping their praxis within the realm of liberalism the goal is preventing them from existing as a form of resistance to do this they utilize ngos even compromised leftist groups the media rumors and liberalism they even have so much as directly had these ngos hire security who would police people doing things such as demanding people remove masks or tone down their langauge or rhetoric 

its important to call this out and expose it for what it is but also pay attention to it so you dont fall victim to it this is literally what keeps any movements from growing in america this is reflected in the following quote in regards to all the anti police brutality movements

i think the uprisings are good but were seeing that they have limitations as a revolutionary uprising these limitations allow the state to subvert the nature of uprisings as well as the issues as mere reforms the state and liberal politicians and others are able to utilize that against the movement this kind of cooptation has been happening for a while ive watched 60 years of protests and socalled riots and rebellions and uprisings in major cities and small towns like ferguson missouri ive watched 60 years of them going back to 1964 with the harlem rebellion in harlem new york it was always something to do with the police one form or another they kill somebody beat somebody or just came in the community and did some kind of atrocity and the people responded with a fight back whats been allowed to happen in this instance is that the people rebel the people fight back and people put up a mass front of protests then the politicians and the others claim to be using their issues or their drive to then turn around and propose some liberal reforms which arent liberal at all actually",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,3,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iiv18h/in_the_coming_months/

a little background on me skip to the end if you dont care bc i got a lot to say 

i have had a horrible past few years and i mean horrible i dont really have any real friends i have 3 friends i talk to on a consistent not in person because i live 3 hours away from all of them but i dont really have much in common with them anymore theyre all liberalcentrist procapitalists not actual capitalists bc they have no capital and are too busy talking about themselvesfinding a way to revert the convo back to themselves the only person i truly have who is there for me is my mom but like all mothers she is not perfect and doessays things that really hurts me which i have let her know but i also have no moneyjob and am at the start of my career and am having a difficult time finding a job whether its in my field or not so moving away is not an option

i decided last year to start organizing and started a local chapter of a revolutionary org i wont say which when i tell yall i was so excited to start this org and find likeminded people and create a spacehome for others who feel the same way and i was even more excited when our regional coordinator told me that other people in the area reached out about starting a chapter i thought this is it its all going to change boy was i wrong long story short i lasted  about 6 months with our selfappointed micromanaging honestly borderline liberal leader after humiliating me in a zoom meeting in front of all the other members over a mistake i had made before finally calling it

i think there is truly a fundamental problem with telling people to simply get out there and start organizing ive come to realize that the types of people who tend to dominate orgssocial movements are much like the people who dominate churches if that makes sense lots of abusers lots of narcissistic behavior and before people get in the comments saying join another org these people also participate in all the other local orgs too  dsa psl you name it

also before anyone in the comments says girl go to therapy just know ive tried and for several more very long reasons thats not an option however if youre in therapy and it has been successful i genuinely love that for you 

sorry for all the whining now onto the part that really matters

i guess i just want to know how others who have maybe gone through similar things got through it i would also love to hear any quotesget reading suggestions on the topic if anyone has any

he prefers to be called alex but many of his contacts inside and outside of prison know him as comrade z

hes the man people who have been at the memorial unit formerly called darrington a 1610bed state prison in southeast texas point to when asked about organizing on the inside like everyone else locked up in texas who is physically and mentally able zuniga a 44yearold from san antonio was required to work without pay while housed at memorial near the unincorporated town of rosharon from 2018 to 2023 he tended livestock and labored in the agricultural fields where hed cut weeds and harvest carrots cabbages and onions before these fields were owned by the texas department of criminal justice tdcj they were plantation land worked by slaves

while he grew up on the south side of san antonio zuniga spent some of his youth in the rural outskirts of laredo this was the extent of his previous exposure to agriculture but he took to farmwork somewhat easily i love animals and i love playing with dirt he told the texas observer in a march interview

but as he began reading about the history of the land he was working and its roots in slaveryand as he learned more about labor movementshe started advocating for himself he would occasionally refuse to work telling officers he wouldnt return to the fields until he received requested safety gear like boots and masks hed get slapped with a disciplinary caseprison policy says that anyone who refuses to work can lose visitation privileges be confined to their cell or receive other punishments that can affect their chances of parole zuniga is currently about 11 years into a 15year sentence

in the end though zuniga said that pushing back would usually get him the things he asked for

in 2019 he became involved with the incarcerated workers organizing committee iwoc a prisonerled arm of the 119yearold labor union the industrial workers of the world iww sometimes they say its illegal for prisoners to unionize but its not zuniga said its just frowned upon but it works

the greatest artists of our generation are randos on social media with less than 10 followers  they will post a masterpiece that brings you to tears like once a month the post will get 2 likes and they will stop posting because theyre sick of wasting their precious time trying to game an unfair algorithm rigged against them

the greatest artists of our generation are burned out disasters who are too busy working soulsucking jobs they hate and havent made anything in months  they feel their creative sparks being snuffed out inside of them because all their mental and physical energy is being drained for no ones benefit except the stockholders

the greatest artists of our generation have never picked up a paintbrush or a microphone or a camera or anything else because they dont think they can  theyve been told theyre not good enough palatable enough marketable enough to even try  theyve been told the arts are pointless endeavors for spoiled rich kids and they should go off and get a useful job no matter how much they despise giving all their time to something they have no passion for  theyre too busy raising kids making ends meet with endless work or just trying to survive to even pick up the arts as a hobby

even if youre not potentially one of the greatest artists of our generation even if you suck complete ass at art this stuff happening to you is still a tragedy  i believe that art is the birthright of all human beings and that every person should be able to just try it and see if they like it whether theyre good at it or not you should be allowed to make art even if its shitty  bad art is better than no art more importantly you enjoyed making it and maybe someone else enjoyed experiencing it it makes me so unbelievably sad that some people even other communists think that the arts are only for the wealthy or elitist snobs when that is so not true  some of the best artists in the world were peasants and proletarians the biggest reason we associate the arts with the elites is because theyre the ones most likely to have the money and time to pursue them

art is something so irrevocably human something so ancient in our development that its almost synonymous with humanity thats why its part of the humanities studies  the mere idea that capitalism ripped so many people away from it or fucked up their relationship to it just to enrich the tiniest percentage of the planet makes me so goddamn angry

 one of the biggest reasons im a socialist is because i want there to be a society where everyone is free to do art if they want to  theres a pretty good oscar wilde essay about this topic

to clarify my differing models i do not mean unable to cooperate just that their economics work in differing ways depending on circumstances these could be large differences

i personally find that each countryregions revolution should reflect the countries status in the world like for instance a socialist government in norway should operate differently from one in angola due to the differences in where the country lies in the hierarchy of states in our current world to be clear this isnt to reinforce and keep these hierarchies but just to recognise what each country needs like i said these wouldnt be differences that halt cooperation

on the other hand some of you will likely argue that identical economic structures must be implemented worldwide with your own valid justifications

2025-02-04 20:52:02,im seeing a lot of misinformation surrounding south africas new land act,"the literal first and only page of the act states that compensation for expropriation will be determined by a number of factors including market price  making it near impossible for expropriation without compensation expropriation without compensation may happen solely based on a courts approval but this rarely happens and for the most part expropriation will work on a willing buyer willing seller basis as has always been the case 

as the eff have pointed out there is a principle known as the gildenhuys principle which determined that as a rule any question of compensation should be according to a twostage approach which prioritizes the marketvalue of the property the price of compensation must start with the marketvalue of the property amp thereafter other factors may be taken into account for decreasing or increasing the price of compensation 

nothing has changed much legally speaking the act is not this grand act of decolonisation im seeing a lot of comrades claim it is its more liberal nonsense as my more wellread friend says 

one of the reasons why the eff amp other leftists dispute this expropriation act besides disputing the acts protection of the right to private property which renders expropriation without compensation nigh impossible is that the act fails to mention the factors determined by this judgment to be relevant for calculating compensation  without abolishing private property expropriation without compensation is extremely unlikely under the new law amp most expropriations will merely result in payments from state funds  which may amount to reimbursing or indemnifying settlers who stole the land in the first place  but not redistribution let alone commonization of land

nevertheless america needed a reason to stop aid from coming to this country as the same friend put it

thats a posthoc argument for why they already cut off funding to rsa the trump government is doing the same to all countries  cuttingoff funding amp coming up with an excuse after the fact for why they did it

2025-02-04 06:11:14,a text from the black anarchist federation years ago during the obama era relevant to the current situation,"when we consider the 1963 march on washington and there are some things which have a direct bearing on the present moment we need to know that back then there had been two wings of the civil rights movement that which emanated from the 195557 montgomery bus boycott which produced dr martin luther king jr as a national leader and his southern christian leadership conference in the period of 19601963 the youthbased student nonviolent coordinating committee had taken the early initiative away from king and sclc and were the ones who had called for and organized the 1963 march on washington originally

they envisioned a much more militant antigovernment protest movement which was coming for a longterm occupation and to disrupt the city of washington dc to accuse the federal government of protecting the racist south and upholding poverty and oppression they even planned to get out on the runways of airports and prevent planes from landing at the airport stop trains and clogs highways and other thoroughfares

malcolm x spoke approvingly of the original protest plans as an advance past dr ml kings pacifism however the kennedy administration was able to maneuver and subvert the autonomous leadership installing the old civil rights leadership which was more conservative and willing to take orders directly from the government they had been bought off by corporate and government grant money and they killed any militancy of the event at all in fact took it from a protest to a celebration of the collusion between the kennedy administration and those sellout leaders claiming victory now

so this tells us what is happening now with the trayvon martin protest movement it has been usurped by al sharpton and more conservative elements those who want to shut down the system and protest in the streets are usurped by those moderate and conservative elements emphasizing peace calm and obeying the law they are saying that we should wait on obama to make up his mind as to whether he will prosecute zimmerman trayvons murderer listen everyday the feds prosecute cases that began in state courts certainly they do it in drug cases against young black men and teens if he wants to do so it should not be some extraordinary thing but he is afraid of the rightwing fascists and his corporate bosses have not given him the sayso yet he must stay in his place and so what wall street tells him too

this is why whatever protest there is in this period has to lead us to insurrection long term resistance known internationally as an intifada it must maintain todays protest militancy as a stage of struggle but escalate first turn it into a month of resistance and then into many months even years of resistance expanding our understanding every step of the way that we are actually fighting the government itself and its corporate masters which has sanctioned white supremacy police terror and vigilante violence as some of their tools of counterinsurgency

we are fighting fascism and must not be neutralized or misled just as huey p newton cofounder of the original black panther party told us 59 years ago they want to kill off black surplus labor homeless and all those elements they consider as social vermin in their emerging corporate police state the death of trayvon martin and all those nameless blackpoc youth must be united in the minds of the people because they expose the empires attack on the poor and low income workers

we must have the maturity to build a united front against racism and police brutality in this period led by the poor blackpoc unemployed and low income workers",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,2,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ihb92o/a_text_from_the_black_anarchist_federation_years/

alongside these existing shortcomings with trump back in office the threats of ice raids antilgbtq policies and imposition of white supremacist curriculum all loom over our heads

our schools wont be fixed by the people that broke them the people of providence need to take back our schools put them under truly local control and prioritize providing a quality education and safe environment for students and faculty

the people united have tremendous power if we organize together we can truly take back our schools

last night governor abbott extended the ability to make immigration arrests to the texas national guard this is an unconstitutional and unprecedented extension of power and is a significant escalation against our communities

abbott wants to lead the attack on our communities by example but we must show them that we are not afraid of their escalations and that texans will not submit to intimidation we are ready to fight back in even greater numbers and with more determination

2025-02-02 20:45:23,could this strategy work,"the recent success of deepseek has made me reflect over the role of digital platforms in our socialist struggle not because i think that chinese platforms are the way out of our system of tech oligarchs and surveillance capitalism but because im certain that damaging us big tech could potentially bring an end to us hegemony which relies  entirely on its monopoly over global currency system thus i propose the following strategy

stage 1 a significant amount of users avoid american platforms and products choosing their chinese counterparts instead
stage 2 the chinese capitalists power over cloud capital allows the  yuan to be more competitive china becomes a counterhegemonic power
stage 3 as us economy begins to fail it slowly loses its influence on the policies of other countries this creates an opportunity for them to unite against their american and chinese masters much like the nonaligned movement intended to do during the cold war our goal as revolutionaries is to make sure that this international association ensures freedom human rights and sustainability

thats why visionary black freedom fighters from dubois to assata shakur to huey newton have looked to socialism as the key to achieving black liberation white supremacy will only be overthrown if it is uprooted alongside the capitalist system that gave birth to it

2025-02-01 04:34:02,communication apps,"hello comrades

i was wondering about if theres a good app that you guys would recommend for communicating between a decently large group of people thats simple to learn and somewhat intuitive ideally the app should have translation options as well

i live in a pretty brown community here in the south this is a very red state and already klansmen have been running around creating trouble in particular a former student of mine had their car broken into tires slashed and a school chromebook stolen in broad daylight this has gotten me pretty disgusted but i am trying to figure out how to do something for my community

to that end i am wanting to set up a neighborhood watch program id like to set it up so that people could readily report if they see any unfamiliar people spreading kkk pamphlets or otherwise acting suspiciously most families in this neighborhood are latino or black theres white neighbors here too like myself but i am unsure of their politics and sympathies  but i am not exactly thrilled if possible i would like this group to also spread word if they see ice around

any recommendations would be appreciated",MrSkeltalKing,socialism,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ieyiez/communication_apps/

2025-01-31 16:28:11,creating communities,"ive seen a decent amount of socialists comment in other threads ripping into people who have lost jobs and income because of the recent executive orders theyre bashing career choices or that certain industries are tools of the capitalist class and those people working for them well boohoo 

as people living in this society we have to participate in capitalism wherever we like it or not we all need to be housed eat buy shit and survive the best was we can some of us picked jobs when we were younger that we have idealogical problems with or we understand the defects of the industry and choose to stay so we can hopefully make change from within i know people who work in all kinds of industries who are socialist or socialist leaning and their job doesnt define them 

correct me if im wrong but shouldnt the goal of socialism to be creating community and getting people on our side so we can create change and start dismantling these systems of oppression not gloating that someone working in governmentforeign aid etc have lost their jobs a lot of these people get into jobs hoping to help others and build them up i would think these people are exactly the kind of people we would want on our side they may not be perfect socialists but we all need to start somewhere 

revolutions never happened because of an individual there have always been communities behind them socialism has gotten a bad wrap by the huge decades long propaganda campaign against it and we need to do good work of promoting ideas that lead to a better society not contributing to its awful public image 

now i hope the people commenting are feds or conservative trolls and not actual mls but if thats the case then thats also pretty damaging to the movement

2025-01-30 20:33:33,translation the story of a delivery rider in china,"q its hard to find work nowadays if you lost your job would you deliver food or drive a cab for didi

a if theres even a sliver of hope dont come to deliver food

the nastiest curse in the delivery world is you deserve to be a delivery rider your whole family deserves to be delivery rider your children and their children deserve to be delivery rider please never say this to a delivery rider this cuts deep it could make them fight you to the death

unless youre truly at the end of your rope like your parents got divorced you have no family youre drowning in credit card debt debt collectors are calling every day you cant scrounge up money for food youve got nowhere to sleep at night youre facing the risk of starving and freezing to death youre homeless youre all alone you cant go back to your hometown youre about to die  if youre pushed to that point then yeah maybe come to deliver food

lets do the math first heres what i wrote back then

forget about anything else just talking about rent bike and food rent is 1000 the bike is 700 food is 1500 and you get six bucks a delivery you might only snag five or six orders during the lunch rush and dinner rush i leave at 1030 in the morning and by 8 pm ive only got 20 orders if i push it till midnight i might reach 30 dont even look at those king of the orders drivers those guys are running from six in the morning till midnight every single day just to hit 40 or 50 deliveries

if you work every day of the month no days off and guarantee 25 deliveries every single day thats at least 700 deliveries a month and you might get a base pay of 5475 but if you dont hit 26 days of full attendance in the month meaning you complete at least 18 deliveries in each shift theyre gonna pay you 675 a delivery thats only 4725 if you do hit 700 deliveries if you are working full time you can get an extra 750 so you make 5475 yuan take off the 3000 fixed costs for everything leaves you with like 2000 while you are dead tired every day and that socalled freedom forget about it they assign you shifts that you need to hit both a minimum time and minimum deliveries if you dont hit those each shift you get 30 yuan deducted they might give you three to five shifts a day if you fail to hit the metrics on all those shifts and thats 150 gone from your paycheck and each shift needs at least 18 deliveries which means if you were to reach the minimum 18 orders for 30 days thats 540 orders a month only about 3780 yuan take off 1000 for the dormitory 700 for the bike and 1500 for food  youre basically working for free

me i usually run twenty or thirty orders a day at six yuan seventyfive a delivery i wake up at 1030 am and if i go back home around 8 pm i can get about 22 or 23 orders if i push myself to 1230 am maybe i get 30 those king of the orders types theyre up early out the door at six in the morning and back at twelve at night delivery work is every day of the month no breaks you need 700 deliveries a month just to get that maybe 5475 base pay you have to do at least 25 deliveries every day to get it and they dont give you any benefits no health insurance no pension dorms are 1000 yuan a month taken directly from your pay by the station renting the bike is 700 a month taken out of pay too food is on you  1500 a month if you make 5475 you might save 2000 but if you just hit the bare minimum 18 orders a day 540 a month thats a 3700 salary take 1000 for the dorm 700 for the bike 1500 for food youre basically working for meituan for free free labor they dont provide the bike food or a uniform nothing they dont give you any work tools on their dime because theres no labor contract or employment contract only a service contract the station makes you register as selfemployed so they can just pay you a service fee every month but if you pay enough they can provide the station makes a lot of money off of these things housing and the bike rental those are good for them do this work your whole life then theres no retirement pay just because theres no social security also some deliveries force the delivery riders to place it in those pickup lockers those arent free meituan doesnt pay for it its 50 cents a use paid by the delivery runner not the customer not meituan the rider pays meituan is making money off of the delivery riders meituans delivery boxes uniforms helmet all of those things the riders have to pay for themselves its a clean 600 you work for meituan and meituan doesnt give you a uniform let alone a bike of course not meituan would never give you something like that but the station the station is happy to rent you a bike before hiring you the station has a cut and its a great tactic putting you in debt right before you start work forcing you to work yourself to death at 6 yuan a delivery just the dorm and bike cost you 60 a day take it or leave it

heres what often gets sent in our group chats

the cops have surrounded xyz shopping mall brothers be careful

the cops have surrounded xyz shopping mall brothers be careful

the cops have surrounded xyz shopping mall brothers be careful

its like almost nobody gets away without a fine everyone gets fined if a rider tells you theyve never been fined by the traffic police theyre lying

and then theres the crashes all riders crash theres no getting around it if you yank down the pants of any new guy youll see half of them with scabs all over their knees im not the only one falling everyones crashing all through their rookie phase all kinds of reasons icy spots on the road in winter after the sprinklers it becomes one big ice rink if you arent careful a guy in my dorm his first accident he smashed his bike and bent the rim and thats the spokes and rim how thick and sturdy they are and he still bent it if hed hit his leg directly who knows if hed ever stand again or come back to it in two years time those riders who do well their shifts are long 40 plus deliveries they get it because they just go fast early to late the faster you go the more orders the algorithm sends and whether you take them is your business the algorithm is pushing you to ride faster but if anything happens its your fault they talk at every morning meeting about riding slow ride slow but if you go slow the algorithm straightup doesnt send you orders if you dont get at least 18 deliveries a day you dont get to go home you are stuck on the road freezing cold yet jobless

and then theres all the other terrible rotten things that happen

like a piece of green landscaping netting getting caught in your wheel and you gotta pull out a knife and cut it off just to keep delivering

and the security guards at some apartment complex not letting you in you gotta walk back and forth and everything gets late

and then you have those m0ron guards who wont let you come in and the customer wont come downstairs to grab it themselves either

and the customer writes the wrong location like that hotel chain hes at one location but he wrote down the address of a different one

and customers not answering their phone when you call and you cant get through the security gate

and sometimes youre knocking on the door for minutes and still cant get a hold of them

and sometimes they spill their food and they want you to pay them more than what they spent on the order

and the navigation is messed up telling you to fly in the sky walk through walls and disappear into the earth

and some apartment complex gates are open during the day and locked at night and then you get there and are staring at a locked gate you gotta ride around all the complex just to find another entrance if it exists

and those deliveries that are all stairs living on the fifth sixth floor with no elevator

and then the supermarket order with boxes and boxes of mineral water

and people just taking food from your orders

and the restaurants delaying the order for half an hour causing all the deliveries youre carrying to go past the time limit

and the train station deliveries enormous stations layers underground overground youre going through security then you finally reach the customer and they say theyre still on the train making you wait sometimes they are still on the subway nowhere near you and wont let you cancel without penalty they tell you if the food gets lost you gotta pay for it the customers food is your problem now

and some restaurants dont wrap it tightly and the food spills everywhere

and some places dont have a unit number no building number or they do have a building number but no streetlights so you just gotta guess based on the map and the gps and you will never ever find it

and some apartments you get out on the ground floor in the elevator but cant leave because there are two levels named ground floor one is 1 and the other is g you only find out when you step out the gate

and the restaurant you ask if the foods ready but they dont say anything when the food is ready all along

and some restaurants where the food is ready but the waiter is eating and wont bag it for you

and some restaurants with terrible attitudes slow and with short fuses

and customers putting their address wrong and then complaining youre not delivering to their location saying im not letting you deliver to that place i want you to come deliver to this place instead

and those sky bridges and overpasses being a total joke you easily crash going over and the gps is also garbage just telling you to go up them on your bike and the cops know so they wait there and they bust anyone trying to go through because its forbidden

and insurance a colleague of mine crashed into a byd car and he ended up paying 500 yuan insurance is a hassle they only cover anything above 300 yuan you gotta call the police to get an accident report and you still gotta pay 300 yuan out of pocket

and then there was that other colleague who broke his leg and had to go back home insurance only covered medical expenses up to 8000 yuan no lost wages no compensation for bodily harm plus he had to pay 300 yuan outofpocket because the insurance deducts 300 yuan

what happened to him was totally unavoidable he broke his leg couldnt move but all the little bumps and scrapes those happen all the time falling down for meters is nothing at all you just pick yourself up and keep delivering i remember when i fell down a couple meters it was a crowd worker that picked me up and helped me back up i didnt have any money at the time so i didnt get an xray the doctor said that since i could still walk there werent any big fractures and even if there were little ones theyd heal with some time i was back out there delivering the next day

and then theres the fact that if you hit an old person or a kid youre screwed for life its not worth risking it for 6 yuan just take the late penalty the risk is too big

and then if you park your bike on the side of the road and some old lady crashes into it and falls down you have to pay for her medical treatment because the parking space youre in isnt legitimate the parking lines are drawn by the mall not by the traffic police

and then this whole thing of barely making ends meet those king of the orders riders who make 18000 a month what kind of human are they anyway machines every morning they leave at 600 am back at midnight every day without rest all year round regular people cant take that theyre older folks they need less sleep youngsters like me if do until midnight then will struggle to get out of bed before 1030 the next day

if this job were really like everyone can make over 10000 a month easily then kids in the rural area wouldnt bother going to university and the landlords in beijing wouldnt hustle to send their kids to study and get citizenship abroad everybody would just go work as delivery riders then everything would be good

the agent who recruited me she kept saying i asked a rider on the road yesterday and that guy made over 10000 yuan a month or the rider i recruited previously made over 10000 yuan last month and the site manager tells you we have a lady at this station who made over 8000 her first month and 15000 in her second of course she has experience from other sites and then that same recruiter was complaining she didnt want her job and i said to her well why dont you go deliver didnt you say its great easily making over 10000 yuan a month and she shut up

and then the cold if you dont deliver food you just dont know what cold is every day when i get back you touch the helmet the power bank in your pocket your phone and theyre frozen like ice blocks and the meat on my thighs and ass are always cold its normal to have your fingers crack open from the cold

i have only worked through the winter never summer in the summer you have to deliver in the rain wearing a raincoat rain is bad weather and everybody has to show up

and holidays youve got to work them all too on new years day i had a fever and they forced me to work all day i nearly died the shifts are already assigned to you you have to show up if you dont and miss five shifts thats a 150 yuan fine and they will tack on another two shifts and then the penalty goes to 210 yuan dont even start talking about labor law riders arent protected by labor law riders dont sign labor contracts or employment contracts we sign cooperation contracts what we get paid is a service fee meituan never sees us as their employees they make riders register as selfemployed treating us like they are business partners so you are signing a cooperation contract and all partners are equal so when the station manager deducts your pay if you say anything theyll be throwing it right back at you saying we signed a cooperation contract im a boss and youre a boss were all here working for meituan those cooperation contracts they are just a contract to sell your soul if you want to quit you have to stick it out another month if you want all the extra incentives you gotta stay for two full months

and in this line of work theres no social security no health insurance nothing for retirement

once you fall into this trap theres no easy way out you have to keep going for at least one or two more months before theyll let you go if you just dont show up the next day they deduct 20 of your service fee if you make less than 2000 they deduct the full 2000 at minimum 2000 yuan

and this job makes you rent a bike before you start youre already stuck with the bike rental theres no getting out loads of people who are getting into delivery already have debts so if they cant make this work theyre facing the overdue rent for the bike another source of debt and they are forced to grit their teeth and keep working to earn money for the rent the bike costs food and then to just pay back debt generally speaking anyone with other options would never choose this many delivery riders are there because they are already in debt the meituan agents and stations know that theyre a group of helpless pitiful people and they exploit it meituan still uses algorithms to force us to speed the intermediaries lie to us to get us to join and stations push you into bike rental contracts once youve joined youve pretty much sealed the deal even if you do not want to you have to grit your teeth and work

a bunch of people curse at the company for exploiting them so much theyre wondering if well have to start paying them to work in fact a lot of training agencies already do that promising to get you into big companies like huawei meituan or xiaomi for a monthly salary of 10 to 20k you just need to go through training half a year costing 20k to 30k no money no problem they help you get a loan you train first and then start paying back once you get a job by the time you complete training the loan is real but whether they get you into the promised company or not is up for debate and even if they get you a job if you are fired a month later you must pay the loan back regardless its the same with the delivery work they make you rent the bike in advance before you even make money  they stick you with debt

its a job that forces you to start with debt and then work after

i was duped by a friend that she turned agent and got me in the station promised me the first three months were free this and the following three months free that saying there are several thousand yuan out there and you cant ever get it unless you work a whole year then you get the bonuses for months 123 700 yuan a month paid out along with the service fee for months 456 and the service fee for months 4 5 and 6 is only paid by the 20th of the following month so if you want to get your full attendance bonus for your first month you have to wait until the 20th of your fifth month but you must work all those months and shouldnt submit a request to quit and then your bonuses for months 456 are along with your service fees of 7 8 and 9 months and the payment is on the 20th of month 8 9 and 10 and once youve submitted your resignation you still have to work another two months to leave for good and until the 21st of month twelve

the recruiter will use any method sweettalk promises and fake incentives to lure you in  like those 5000 yuan newcomer bonuses that are just impossible to get and 6888 yuan winter bonuses theyre like a carrot dangling in front of a donkeys face that poor donkey will keep trying desperately to get it but the ending is the donkey dying while ridden to the ground forever without the carrot

when you join the station will give you stacks of paper discussing how the service fees are calculated but no regular person understands any of it and most will just go with it halfheartedly and ends up falling into the trap and becoming a meal on the plate for the stations and agents once you join the station makes money once you complete one month the agent gets her commission the moment they get their money they stop caring if you make any money or not work or dont leave if you dont like it china is never short on cheap labor

scientists doctors and pilots are irreplaceablethose are resources those kind of abundant endless cheap labor we are nothing but consumables

every time i think about when the station showed me the service fee spreadsheets with those king of the orders making 17000 or 18000 and when they gave me that thick stack of papers to explain how the services fees are calculated i think of that image a donkey with blinders on walking in circles around a millstone while the owner is whipping it beside him shouting the good times are just around the corner

delivery riders just like those taxi drivers from the past and like xiangzi pulling his rickshaw its the same thing whether you make money is a big question mark but the bike rental companies the stations the agents the factories making helmets uniforms food containers and meituan itself theyre all certainly raking it in

if you want to make it work you have to be all in first its about enduring the hours and secondly about riding fast to endure the hours youre doing what those king of the orders do  up at 630 am and back at midnight you get 6 yuan a delivery do more and each delivery will make 7 8 yuan because there are bonuses for completing more incentives for finishing more orders and showing up plus tenure bonuses so if you make 6000 8000 9000 something a month or reach the 17000 18000 mark like those kings thats up to you alone fixed costs are 3000 a month 1000 housing 700 bike rental and 1500 food second is riding fast the faster you ride the system is going to be sending you more you speed to the point that the electric bike rim is so bent out of shape the algorithm is all about their numbers when several riders are near a business the system compares the data of the riders the one with the better metrics gets the delivery first and youre getting four five six or even seven eight lunch orders at the same time up to nine for preorders you still cant deliver too early unlike a normal order where you can deliver earlier and complete it right away a preorder you gotta drop at the time specified delivering earlier by more than 7 mins is the same as being overdue which heavily penalizes your order placement sometimes you have so many preorders you cant complete other deliveries you are trapped there once the timer hits and you complete them your other deliveries will be late youre basically barely beating the 7 minute deadline for them to be on time

new riders also have to rent a bike frame at about 699 yuan a month once youve done it for three months you can buy a bike frame and rent the battery for 2300 yuan on your own used bike frames are only 1000 yuan another option would be 400500 yuan ones with missing mirrors or brakes completely gone busted plastic shell they dont ride fast and those are the cheapest options on the market you need to get a bike that has the bare minimum so that you can go over the bridges and the underpasses and if you have a worndown 1000 yuan frame the tire will be flat if you dont change them you are bound to fall during tight cornering and slide if you brake if you dont you will inevitably crash and have to pay for the car damages or the potential leg break it will cost way more than the two tires to fix that

that younger colleague of mine who had been running deliveries for only a month was already doing almost 50 orders a day he rides so fast he could bend the wheel rim on his bike even when using the brakes and his tires were new if he cannot stop with new tires you will certainly not be able to brake with old tires plus the fact that the roads at night are full of puddles or the water from the sprinklers freezes which makes it impossible to brake the only option is to ride slower i would definitely never go so fast after falling once i learned my lesson and that colleague i had before he broke his leg and went home insurance only covered medical expenses up to 8000 yuan he still had to pay 300 yuan out of pocket no lost wages no compensation for pain and suffering getting that other kind of coverage requires proof from the public security bureau and the human resources and social security bureau and its complicated so he gave up and chose the former later on i looked at his bike the tires were new but still didnt grip my tires are much flatter than his so i definitely wont go that fast

ive seen a lot of people on the street in beijing with niu bikes taking their kids home you can spot them with the two white lights on the side and the white circle light in from i asked one lady and she said it cost her six or seven thousand yuan and then i saw one with a blue ring a beijing native and i figured it would be about the same six or seven thousand yuan since it was a niu but he told me two or three ten thousand so i asked how fast it goes and he said over 100 kmh i asked if hed modded it and he said theres nothing original left on it that might be the ceiling of electric bikes in this business no delivery rider can afford that the most expensive bike ive seen so far was when i was picking up a delivery i thought it would be 23000 yuan and he said that it was over 10000 yuan complete i asked him how that could be so then i noticed that it had the name ninebot on the side sure those ninebot frames are usually expensive plus a bigger battery that rider he could knock out 50 deliveries in one shift its unbelievable so skilled i wonder if i could push myself and become like that if you dont want to do this for the rest of your life its not worth it to buy a battery if you are just in this for a year or two then renting the batteries is a great choice

lots of riders dreams are just like the xiangzi is getting a battery bike of their own instead of renting the upside from that in our society is that the delivery bikes seldom get stolen thieves dont go after a delivery riders bike the old people going into subway stations and grabbing raincoats or gloves do not target riders since those items dont have a lot of value the elderly know how difficult and painful it is to be a rider  plus the windscreens and rain gear are so cheap and terrible they have zero value

those cheap rented or bought delivery battery bikes basically never get stolen because theyve crashed whoknowshowmany times the tires are so flat and thin and both the bike frames and the batteries usually have gps trackers thieves only steal bikes that arent for deliveries especially expensive bicycles in subway stations delivery battery bikes are modified by the rental companies with gps no one wants to handle those thefts as they are just too easy to trace one stolen bike can bring down a whole black market operation

the more expensive battery bikes do get stolen more often usually in subway stations delivery drivers who personally bought their own battery bikes the theft is less common they have gps and insurance so they get some compensation for the loss if they are stolen

i used to wonder if it was colder in the morning or evening and the result of the test was both were hell a type of cold impossible to bear

theres one thing colder than both the morning and the evening in beijing and that feeling is when youre riding several kilometers in the cold late at night against the wind climbing to the 6th floor just to earn 6 yuan and then you get stopped by the traffic police and told they will fine you 70 yuan of the 6 yuan by 6 yuan that you so carefully put aside or the station is deducting hundreds of yuan from your service fee that feeling is colder than anything your heart gets colder than your frozen fingers and toes out on the road

especially when traffic police are unfair letting others go but singling you out and when the station tells you of course you got fined for disobeying the traffic laws and the agent just lightly says to you you have to follow traffic rules and you feel like youve fallen into an ice hole your heart is colder than an ice cube much colder than your fingers and toes ive personally experienced this and thats how i learned the meaning of heartchilling the fines dont come out of the stations or the agents pockets they act like not their business some even mock you in a gleeful manner

after being treated unfairly by that spiteful acnefaced traffic police and getting fined i was riding my bike crying and shouting obscenities in the middle of the night i yelled out on the street why are you treating me like this

then i called the bureau of supervisors and filed a complaint against that traffic police officer i told them he had been unfair maliciously picking on me the supervisors said they would just have a meeting with him and that it might affect his chances of getting a good review but really what should happen is for us to swap places make him do deliveries and let me do the ticketing then he would really know how that felt

delivering food isnt all bad you can still find ways to enjoy it sort of like i treat it like a game the pickup points and delivery points become like quest markers finding them is like successfully locating the goals and successfully picking up or delivering an order is like completing a quest with a reward six plus yuan per delivery

then when youre thirsty you gotta find places that offer free hot water and when youre freezing you have to know of places where you can sit down and warm up for a bit and when youre hungry you need to find places that are both cheap and clean

sometimes when riding past a hotel where ive done a delivery it feels like when you walk past npcs after youve completed all the quests no matter what you do they wont trigger an event it can be kinda fun if i have a good day and complete a lot of orders  34 36  then i feel like our male ancestors when they came back from a successful hunt carrying loads of game that feeling is very grounding even though its only 200 yuan and take away 30 for dorm and 20 for the bike rental there is a possibility of having 150 yuan left plus you got some exercise they have to pay to go to the gym but i have to climb several 6story buildings carrying the battery packs which are heavy its way more practical than going to the gym most importantly that 150 yuan is going to guarantee you food tomorrow itll make sure you wont starve or freeze to death our ancestors felt good about successful hunts because they knew they wouldnt starve they would survive and there is nothing better than surviving

besides using meituan power banks and my own data cable i can also charge through the bikes usb port but its super slow and when you have the gps on and the meituan app it tends to drain your phone quicker one night all of a sudden i got four orders one after the other and my phone was at 20 it was really worrying and i had to deliver to the upper floors having to unhook the phone from the bike was risky the solution i came up with was to dim my screen all the way open low battery mode and not use gps i did the delivery from memory except to check the addresses i did not turn on the mobile screen it was really thrilling my battery kept going back and forth between 23 and 18 it was a total win then i reached home i was so elated haha its just like how it feels to turn the tables in a video game

basically apart from the traffic police the stations meituan and a few security guards the whole of society is treating delivery workers with a degree of respect every day in our groups were cursing at the traffic police and wang xing and i even overheard a rider at the station next to mine saying that if china goes to war with america the first thing he would do is find the station manager with a weapon haha

i also advise people not to mess with delivery riders its an industry with very low barriers to entry and a serious lack of people so you find all types there the recruitment companies are even placing people who were turned away from security companies due to a record with the stations normally people with a record couldnt pass meituans system but when there is a lack of drivers stations find ways around it the system develops bugs

if you have problems with your delivery try not to leave negative reviews or file complaints if possible delivery companies penalties for riders are extremely severe some riders cant survive it if you did file bad reviews or complaints at some point dont be afraid though as long as they werent malicious riders hate the meituan company not you

then the matter of battery charging i had to make sure my bike was always charged so i needed to trade it out when it was roughly 30 i also know which rural areas in beijing have all the full batteries so usually its like this i wake up go to the bathroom have breakfast swap batteries pick up a power bank complete the lunch rush eat return the power bank and go back to my dorm i have to nap every day or i wont hold on to 12 am if i get a nap then i can make it to 12 am then i can wake up in the morning if i dont nap i can fall asleep on my bike even by 10 pm the batteries tend to get weak from the cold the only longlasting full batteries are the ones that you pick up right out of the charging station those that have been out in the cold dont last every time i went to those rural secluded charging stations i felt like i was following a guide to a secret mission and getting epic gear

when i started out the health of my mobile battery was rated at 95 a week later after deliveries it plummeted to 31 the wind in the beijing mornings and evenings is icy doing deliveries involves riding against this wind its all about convective heat transfer it was as if i was freezing my phone in the freezer its common to wreck a battery in one winter once the battery has been wrecked it doesnt last charges slower and over heats when its charged overheating isnt a problem in the winter but the battery life is especially weak and overheating during charging is fixed after just being exposed to the cold and wind for a minute and will freeze right away you dont have to worry about your phone overheating

and then theres the bouncing from riding the bike after half a month of doing this my mobiles camera keeps shaking im really still but the mobile camera keeps trembling when im delivering i am forced to take pictures and my camera wont focus thats from all those bumps then theres the gps arrow direction its skewed but it always corrects itself after moving around for a while my phone gyroscope was wrecked as well this is what we have to sacrifice in this job

data cables are really easy to wreck in the first two weeks i wrecked four cables thats because my power bank in my chest pocket kept falling over creasing them like that later on i plugged the data cable on the bikes usb once i got a new one i started keeping the powerbank in my pants pocket which made the wires last a lot longer though in the end they still break

i treat these losses as money i spent in this video game

on the last day of the incentive programs when riders are pushing i would leave at six thirty in the morning i didnt go back all day and just did the annoying deliveries that no one else wanted while waiting for the food from the restaurant i would actually fall asleep because it was warm inside then after walking outside i would be energized once again i would continue delivering until 12 am to get another delivery in and the pleasure i got just like that youre playing a video game where you finish a particularly tough quest and sometimes i would take shortcuts over sky bridges run through changan street and use tunnels because under normal circumstances i would have taken the longer routes if you get caught by traffic police once its equivalent to a days food expenses and that 20 yuan turns into 40 yuan if you dont pay up right away theyll make you pay when you buy a car or ride a scooter but i know virtually no delivery rider who pays since we will spend the rest of our lives doing deliveries and we will never be able to afford a car

ive already fallen into this trap before when the station manager cursed at me the traffic police stopped me when i bumped into an old lady when i was forced to work with a high fever i gritted my teeth and bore it all what i can do now is ride as fast as i can and see if i can do forty fifty or even sixty orders per day like them if i cant consistently hit forty orders a day then theres no point in doing this job its just a waste of my time if next month my order count is still just twenty or thirty a day when this freezing winter is over when my service fees are finally paid out when ive paid for my dorm and my bike and i still have money for food and theres no more immediate risk of starving or freezing to death and i have moved on from the imminent threat of dying i might just leave this industry its just like youre terrible at a game you practice and practice you still get thrashed so you uninstall the game haha

the main reason for my suffering lies with my family i dont have parents anymore they divorced and i can no longer contact either of them my grandparents on both sides have also passed away and most people who lose their job can go back to their hometown ask their parents for help but my hometown is not home anymore theres no place for me there later on i learned that people like me are called drifters that we are the typical social outcasts

when i was little i used to sleep in the same room as my grandpa i didnt like my own pillow and i was always using his pushing closer to him then every morning i would be asleep on his side of the bed actually i didnt want to use my grandpas pillow i just wanted to be near him when i was young even though i was malnourished and thin as a twig i had a lot of energy and i loved to run around  climbing trees climbing onto roofs one time i fell off the wall of the pigsty and scraped a piece of skin off my nose my grandma was cooking nearby and i sat in her lap as a village elder came to visit and asked my grandma why i was so quiet

if i could i would use 20 years of my life to give my grandparents 10 years each or even split the rest of my life into three pieces one for my grandpa and one for my grandma those are the only two people in this world who i would ever agree to do that for but its just wishful thinking they have long gone from me forever and they only exist in my memories ill never see them again i really wish there was a place that could contain those that have passed whether its the western heaven or the buddhist pure land i really hope that it actually exists so when i die i can go to that place and stay forever with my grandparents

on the day when i was injured and had to rest aside from having gone to the hospital i also rode my bike back to the area where i used to live before starting deliveries the area where i used to live has a cat downstairs if i could afford to rent again the budget room where i used to live before i would adopt it it was such a good cat a tabbyragdoll cross it was so wellbehaved and chubby with a big rounded head soft paws with a fluffy neck it loved to hold its tail straight up it was a scared little tomcat but it was very affectionate it must have been abandoned there wasnt one ounce of wildness in it it couldnt survive on its own and i feel like hes a lot like me i dont have parents and it doesnt have an owner im like an unemployed wanderer while its a stray cat i lost my job it lost its home i was abandoned by my parents it was abandoned by its owner i had unsupportive parents and it had some terrible owner i went back there and looked for it all over but i didnt find it  i called for it many times and looked for it seven times and it didnt come i had a dream about it a few nights before i went and i woke up in the middle of the night afraid something had happened to it when i leave ill go back again and look for it i really wish i find it and adopt it

lee myungbak said in his biography that throughout his entire life he had gained just as much as he had lost but from my perspective in these 20 years of my life it seems ive only lost and not gained anything apart from my life there isnt anything i can lose anymore if i continue living what will i get will i even ever get to live the life i want",Howling-wolf-7198,socialism,1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1idwrbe/translation_the_story_of_a_delivery_rider_in_china/

2025-01-29 15:58:22,fresh recruit to activism what should we do,"hey ive lurked in the socialism movement ever since 20182019 ive followed a lot of left leaning content on tik tok and other platforms just to help stay informed since that seems to be half of the battle

im not here ask how to start a revolution but more importantly am seeking advice to keep my community safe i have social anxiety so being in public spaces has always been kind of difficult something im working on getting better at however with everything that has happened within the past 10 days i cant sit idle while my country usa dies my thoughts are a little scattered as im pretty nervous typing all of this stuff out so bare with me lmao

heres are my goals and questions associated to achieve them

preferably flex my 2nd amendment right and encourage those within my community to do the same self defense purposes only while i am not advocating for violence as it is against reddits community guidelines however i am not blind to the dire situation within the usa how would you go about this tactfully wo people getting the wrong idea is this idea something i should even entertain

i want to create fliers to hand out to people within my community but am no design artist or put on peoples doorsteps i have a blackwhite printer that can print basic paper but nothing too extravagant any tips on how to create that sort of stuff would be fantastic

messaging is key from my observation the left seems to have an incredibly difficult time resonating with people under the influence of propaganda there will inevitably be people who are gonna spread misinformation and try to combat our movement weve already saw this with antifa during 2020 how would you combat this my thoughts are using our american founding fathers quotes or stuff from the declaration of independence that way we can better protect our image from the far right

i understand that there is a risk of discussing topics like this on subreddits or other forums but at this point i feel as though its a necessary risk are there any better ways of communicating with people who are on the same page or is local community gathering the far more effective

are there any contentworks from specifically poc i can use to educate myself i am a person of privilege so i admit that i lack some awareness to their space i want to effectively utilize my privilege to protect my fellow americans from fascists pigs for lack of better words

i am under the notion that we need to carefully fan the flame of passion for saving our democracy the altright has already given us a head start by not only taking away rights but also screwing the american people with tons of executive orders that were signed im not sure how our government is going to handle combating the fascist party at the current moment but ive lost faith that they will even protect americans how would you bring liberal leaning people to our side

so easter comes around and my family gather as they usually did my aunt who is a christian conservative and looking strikingly similar to sarah palin im not making this up asks me how i was doing given that i was in middle school watching a pirate anime i tell her about it oh its this cartoon called one piece and its about pirates

i didnt think anything of it was going to happen

fourth of july rolls around the same year and the family gathers again and my aunt is like you cannot watch one piece because it is marxist propaganda

now at the time i was in middle school i did not know what marxism communism socialism leninism maoism anarchism all of that was im an ancom in my 30s now but back then i had no idea what the fuck she was talking about

in all truth one piece does have arguably antiauthoritarian themes and theres even an entire revolutionary army whose goal is to dismantle the world government but thats not what she was on about

apparently it was the theme song

the pirate rap

so i listen to it again years later and i think i found it

usopps doing that marxist thing

usopp is a marksman and the lyric said marksman thing but come on yall usopps doing that marxist thing lets go communism will fucking win get scared palin because we palin your imperialist ass into the bering strait woooooo

2025-01-28 17:38:04,are we sure a general strike isnt the way here,"okay with all the this shit happening in the us are we triple super certain a general strike push now not waiting until 2028 isnt what we need anyone whos done or been in one ie other countries what are your thoughts seriously we are super fucked right now and when its brought up it seems like people come in to sagely waive the jedi mind trick hands saying one does not simply do a general strike that takes infinity planning

maybe but im having doubts about it not being needed to kick the hell into high gear now this week of the us facing rapid deterioration of due process rights trump planning some vaguely worded exec order to cut all federal loans and grants even if not social security and medicare that too seems real bad trump floating the idea of penal colonies to basically deport us citizens who are repeat offenders whatever tf that means to a serial criminal and now the nlrb firing plus all the federal union employees getting screwed now  the many attacks on diversity rights in the workforce and on and on just asking if theres a way to get pressure on this quicker than whats being discussed for 3 years from now at this rate in 3 years unions will be toast

edit 1 apparently trump is now shutting illinois out of medicaid a spokesman for illinois democratic gov jb pritzkers office said the states agencies have reported issues accessing the website used to request disbursement for medicaid payments

2025-01-28 08:12:19,can trump be meaningfully resisted without facing some form of retribution like imprisonment or bodily harm,"obviously whats happening in the states right now is terrible we are confronted daily with an onslaught of news about another essential wing or function of the us government being dismantled by his administration or foreign relations being tested etc the future of our country is precarious with him at the helm and his party falling in line 

but what can we do about it what would actually work and i dont just mean in terms of theoretical effectiveness im also thinking about the practicality of launching the actions and getting enough people involved

im part of the problem by the way i make sure to vote blue whenever i can but i sit inside all day despite caring a lot about the environment healthcare access and progressive causes in general but i am discouraged from participating or organizing because of major social anxiety fear of punishment by this administration and as aforementioned simply not knowing what i should do and maybe this is tmi but you can view my profile and see that a lot of my insecurity is tied up with my being really short for a male and just overall not being very attractive and honestly with all male politicians being tall and with the height bashing that i see against ben shapiro i cant help but feel like i wouldnt be listened to or respected if i tried to organize i can be awkward around new people but im not a dick or anything but yeah just another practical consideration more important things of course but another thing that keeps me from getting involved sorry if thats tmi ive tried to start environmental advocacy stuff on my college campus and failed so bad people would not engage but l saw them participating in other env stuff so i just assumed that i was the problem im graduated now and deciding what to do with my life and my experience with that is sadly really discouraging

back to effectiveness of protests i have family members who were imprisoned by their country middle east for their political behaviors and i dont think it really made that much of a difference there and call me selfish but i dont want to go to prison or get beaten by police lol

my concern with marches demonstrations and other forms of protest is that they can be ignored right i doubt they would change trumps mind anyway he has shown that he would not care about a march against his policies 

and a strike would probably be more effective but how would one be organized people need to work and would probably be wary of participating out of fear over the strike not being widespread enough 

so what then yes we have been backed into a corner but do we just give up i cant accept that things can and should be better but i just dont know what to even do and if i could make a real difference",Puzzled_Cherry_5613,socialism,11,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ibwvef/can_trump_be_meaningfully_resisted_without_facing/

2025-01-28 14:39:08,deepseek ai released as open source to assist workers world wide,"capitalism uses new technology to build fortified empires corporations which are than used to extract cash from both willing and coerced buyers this has happened most notably over the decades with personal computers the internet and cell phones

these new technologies were supposed to be labor saving systems that would free humans from a 40 hour work week the exact opposite has happened workers continue to be exploited while a few elite capitalists obtain obscene levels of wealth

ai is another technology that is supposed to increase productivity and free workers from a 40 hour work week but we know that under capitalism it will be used to enrich a few while the masses are left in squalor

the deepseek ai platform is owned by a chinese hedge fund but i assume the cpc is a partial owner andor has significant control over the company 

my theory is that deepseek was released as open source to prevent this new technology from being made inaccessible to the masses if ai is going to increase productivity it should be used to benefit workers directly rather than enriching a few elite capitalists

this is all speculation on my part but it would be an important part of china achieving socialism by 2050

   but capitalism would have open arms for fascism because fascism also goes against socialism while not threating private owner ship and fascism uses culture war and scape goats to a even bigger extent which capitalism already naturally uses

2025-01-27 02:14:09,we are more than cogs we are the revolution,"for too long weve been fed a lie a lie that were free that this system works for us that if we just work hard enough well achieve the dream but look closerthe dream is a mirage designed to keep us chasing while they reap the rewards the few those at the top have declared themselves gods ruling over us as though they own not just the wealth but the very air we breathe

the truth is harsh but it must be said we are nothing more than cogs in their machine spinning endlessly to make the rich richer the powerful more powerful but if we cant live free the system cant stand

weve been told that scarcity is the reason for our struggle that there arent enough resources so we must compete fight and claw for scraps but thats another lie think about this there are over 333 million people in america aloneand the reality is we have the resources to stop the constant churn of mass production to live sustainably and still thrive theres enough land food energy and technology to create a society that ensures every single persons survival and dignity

so why dont we because this system thrives on greed corporations would rather let food rot in warehouses than give it to the hungry theyd rather pollute rivers and destroy forests than lose a dollar of profit theyd rather exploit our personal data manipulate us with marketing and push endless consumerism than admit the truth this isnt about meeting our needs its about feeding their power

they sell us the illusion of choice while using psychological manipulation to control our desires theyve turned our lives into commodities our data into currency and our labor into fuel for their machine the system wasnt built to serve usit was built to enslave us but our unity their downfall

history shows us the truth from the gilded age of robber barons to the billionaires of today the system has always been rigged corporations crush workers to cut costs politicians sell their souls to the highest bidder wars are waged to protect profits not people many voices one movement is their greatest fear

but heres the thingthey only win if we stay divided theyve spent decades pitting us against each other left vs right rural vs urban black vs white its a strategy straight out of orwells 1984 they want us too distracted fighting one another to see the real enemy because they know the truth we are more than cogs in their machine we are the revolution

think about the power we hold together we outnumber them a thousand to one together we are unstoppable they control the wealth the media and the laws but none of that matters if we refuse to comply if we unite resist and rebuild we can create a system that works for all of us not just the privileged few the time is now unite resist rebuild

this isnt just about tearing down their machine its about building something better a future where no one is exploited for a paycheck where no child goes hungry where no voice is silenced because it challenges the status quo its about reclaiming the dream theyve stolen from us rise as one reclaim the future

we are done begging for scraps from their table were done watching as they strip our communities of opportunity while lining their pockets were done believing the lie that this is just the way things are no gods no mastersonly freedom

they want you to feel small powerless but remember this their power comes from us every hour we work every dollar we spend every time we stay silent fight the few empower the many if we withdraw that power their system crumbles

we stand at a crossroads on one side is the broken system they want us to accept on the other is a future we can build together a future where were no longer cogs in their machine but the architects of our destiny the choice is clear their system our power one reckoning

ill leave you with the words of thomas jefferson when injustice becomes law resistance becomes duty

we condemn the violent and indiscriminate deportation of undocumented immigrants in the united states which egregiously violates fundamental human rights these actions serve as a political weapon against the people of latin america as articulated by president gustavo petro we refuse to be dominated

now is the time for solidarity with the people of latin america who face sanctions and blockades we echo president petros call for dignified treatment of all immigrants and affirm that latin americans will never bow to oppressive demands of the united states together we fight back

2025-01-26 23:11:30,question did greed an exploitation exist precapitalism  a few brief thoughts i wanted to share,"yes they existed in precapitalist societies eg feudalism mercantilism but i must  stress that capitalism transforms these tendencies into structural imperatives

second it seems implied that these are pre of human nature i do not agree while these traits may have existed historically capitalism naturalizes them as inevitable obscuring the possibility of alternative social arrangements for me capitalism doesnt merely reflect human natureit actively shapes and reinforces a specific version of human nature aligned with its logic

third point lets reflect on isolated acts of greed possible in any era and a system that rewards and necessitates such behavior precapitalist societies might have had exploitative hierarchies but capitalism uniquely embeds a dogeatdog ethos into economic and cultural life making empathy a liability in contexts like labor markets or corporate governance",MycoEngineer,socialism,1,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iatdz0/question_did_greed_an_exploitation_exist/

why it matters the documents confirm latino civil rights pioneers longheld suspicions that the federal government was monitoring  even disrupting  their activities

the documents from 1968 to 1983 were released in late december deep on the cias website at the request of reps joaquin castro dtx and jimmy gomez dca
the big picture the cache of documents gives a glimpse into how the cia viewed activists work as threats

that includes denverbased activist rodolfo corky gonzales and farmworker union leader cesar chavez
documents also show how the cia sought to keep tabs on mexican american student activists in arizona california and colorado even having undercover agents infiltrate student groups
the documents primarily relate to operation chaos  a cia domestic espionage project targeting american citizens that operated under former presidents johnson and nixon
zoom in the cia kept close tabs on gonzales a leader in the radical chicano movement of the 1970s as he pressed for equal rights and called for the potential formation of independent local regional and national chicano political parties documents show

like the black power movement the chicano movement focused on racial pride nationalism and fighting poverty
the cia also was monitoring if chavez would attend demonstrations organized by the southern christian leadership conference in new york city on the 3rd anniversary of kings 1968 assassination
the cia was following salvatore h castro a teacher and advisor in the 1968 los angeles high school walkouts over discrimination

what theyre saying this document release is an important window into the governments efforts to surveil and disrupt peaceful latino organizing in the 1960s and 1970s castro said in a statement to axios

castro praised cia director william j burns for the transparency


im hopeful that these documents will help us build a better record of past overreach and establish stronger guardrails to protect against unwarranted surveillance in the future
yes but the fbi has not released any documents on latino civil rights leaders as requested by castro

between the lines historians in recent years have uncovered quite a bit about fbi surveillance of latino leaders through open records requests brian behnken an iowa state university history professor tells axios

the fbi monitored the works of civil rights leader hctor p garca the new yorkbased puerto rican young lords party and later the activities of the chicano movement
works by scholars and activists over the years have also uncovered that the fbi has monitored chicano movement leaders gonzales reies lpez tijerina jos angel gutirrez and dolores huerta
little was known about how active the cia was involved in monitoring latino civil rights groups and leaders

some latino leaders and their families may not even know about the fbi files and wouldnt know they needed to file open records requests
the intrigue castros mother rosie castro was monitored by the fbi for her activities in the chicano movement files show

2025-01-26 20:43:34,critique on american marxism from a chilean,"hello i am from chile and i moved to the united states a few years ago i have met a lot of great american marxists and i ve made a lot of friends but there are some glaring problems with our movement

the modern marxist movement in the us faces a number of challenges that make it less effective than it could be one of the biggest issues is fragmentation there are so many different groups with different takes on marxismdemocratic socialists ecosocialists anarchists etcthat its hard to find a unified message this lack of focus weakens the movements ability to offer a clear alternative to capitalism

another problem is the shift toward reformism instead of pushing for a full break from capitalism many marxists today focus on reforms like medicare for all or the green new deal while these are important causes they dont really challenge the system itself they make capitalism more bearable but not any less exploitative even as the democratic socialists of america dsa grows they havent come up with a real strategy to overthrow capitalism

the movement also faces cooptation by mainstream liberal politics the leftwing critique of inequality and oppression has been absorbed by liberals who rather than challenging capitalism directly use these ideas to improve the system without changing it this means that marxism has become diluted and less revolutionary

a major weakness is also the lack of organization without a strong unified political party or clear strategy the movement cant turn its ideas into action all we have is bs like cpusa while movements like occupy or black lives matter have raised awareness theyve struggled to create lasting change theres no organized sustained effort to challenge the system at a national level

finally capitalism has proven to be surprisingly adaptable even with all its flaws the system has evolvedthrough welfare programs consumer culture and other reformsin a way that makes its contradictions harder to see i love throwing poopy everywhere and playing in it this has made it harder for marxism to inspire mass movements or capture the publics attention in a meaningful way

to become more effective the movement needs to get back to its revolutionary roots focus on building real workingclass solidarity and address the interconnected struggles of race gender and class without this it will remain sidelined and irrelevant",Holiday-Economist526,socialism,4,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1iapru0/critique_on_american_marxism_from_a_chilean/

i am concluding more and more that our current administration is mainly interested in enriching billionaires at the expense of the rest of us hence the increased privatization of schools and prisons among other things this is the same thing that happened in germany in the 1930s the parallels aren strikingly similar people seem to naively think that nazi germany was some kind of history aberration but in fact it happens repeatedly over time and we are in the next iteration of fascism  the attacks on free speech increase in propaganda fear mongering around minority groups and immigrants hyper focus on culture wars etc are all cause for concern we really dont want to be like putins russia but some people are actually convinced that doing evil is fine

i am a cis gendered white heterosexual middle class married male so im safe at the moment im agnostic so thats probably my one minority status but everyone else is at risk i hear that idaho is going after marriage equality so i wouldnt be surprised if the supreme court overturns the 2015 ruling its sick 

i just wonder what we can do the checks and balances have been significantly weakened and trump can do a lot of damage in two years before the next election cycle  the us was build on the backs of slaves and murdered millions of indigenous americans so given our history i guess this is a logical conclusion we were never exceptional or good as a country we have and always will do immoral things in the name of progress and freedom just today the white house illegally fired government inspectors who are tasked with scrutinizing the actions of federal agencies to make sure they are acting above board as one person has pointed out its purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night

however it is nothing like what i have seen out of the us with trumps new cabinet being littered with oligarchs and capitalists how does the us build up its union movement in my opinion and feel free to tell me if you disagree but most people in their day to day lives feel the pain of a class divide most acutely at their workplace 

unions offer an organisational structure that can shift that disgruntled worker into a comrade through organising i know this is not new information to us socialists and i understand that the government has made it extremely difficult to organise trade unions but i wonder what the approach is to organise our labour movement because besides high profile cases of amazon starbucks or the writers guild i have seen a concerning lack of action out of the american union movement

so why the hell arent europe and the left fighting back its not like we dont have the talent or resources there are plenty of people with the technical skills and creativity needed for such operations it is not rocket science but we seem to be stuck playing defense or clinging to the idea that we can win this battle through honest debate or factchecking alone thats not how this war is being fought if we want to protect democracy human rights and the future of our societies we have to start using the same weapons the other side is wielding so effectively

are there any leftleaning or centrist organizations activists or even funders out there who are ready to take this seriously im talking about creating campaigns that expose the farright for what they truly are spread damning truths or if needed exaggerations about putin trump the afd or any other group that threatens progress and equality lets flip the script and use fear and emotion to protect people from falling for their lies

imagine planting stories that reveal how farright parties like the afd in germany plan to turn women into breeding machines or how their policies will destroy the working class they claim to protect imagine tearing apart their narratives and hitting them where it hurts their base if they can manipulate the algorithms and media landscape to turn people against democracy why cant we fight back just as hard but for a better cause

i think about this a lot  the left wing is systematically less well armed than the right if they wanted to some hypothetically prevalent group of right wing radicals could shoot us all in the streets whenever they chose which as im sure many of you are aware wouldnt be a novel historical event 

in short i feel like ideas of gun ownership and self organization are poisonous in modern left wing circles and were at a point in our political climate where that feels somewhat unsafe to me

2025-01-25 21:17:28,get classredictionism out of your politics now,"this week has been hell especially for many in marginalized groups socialists we need to talk

socialism is the antidote to fascism we know this however weve seen clear and damaging psyops in recent years of us civil unrest and pandemic isolation to try to convince particularly white male leftists that we dont need to fight for the culture stuff not just old more obvious tricks like larouchites and nazbols or their new forms like patriotic socialists maga communists etc im talking about class reductionist ideology that more easily blends into leftist circles of the redbrownism in the postleft suspected thielfunded ops jimmy dore and adjacent orgs that let members espouse similar ideas ill not name to not stir sectarianism

the right wing has long tried to pervert socialist phrases or sentiments of no war but class war or class war not culture war to mean we dont need to fight against discrimination used to divide the workingclass class if thats your view ask how is that working out this week do you think oligarchs are spending all that money on influencers podcasters and psyops telling people culture shit is not smart and isnt material bro for the benefit of socialists no they are because once they convince white men or others at the top of socioeconomic hierarchies that they dont have to fight discrimination then fascists will flood the zone where the fight has been given up white male socialists in particular are told to believe that the answer is as easy as just fight for class stuff not culture stuff so if i just talk about minimum wage increases and universal healthcare socialism will grow meanwhile fascists this week are firing dei workers criminalizing immigrant workers and their families erasing trans people making women into birthing brood domestic servants theyd rather didnt work and so on you know the culture stuff yes they have pounced on the fact that neoliberals have soldout the fight for material needs of the workingclass wages housing education healthcare unions etc but they are also pouncing on the idea theyve been sowing to convince the workingclass that we dont need to fight for each other against discrimination in those material spheres

that point blank is not socialism

the idea that issues are purely class or culture is a trap meant to divide us i dont know where the line is and i know the cia fbi oligarchs etc have pushed people at different ends of cultural beliefs to sow division i welcome resources on how we fight the socioeconomic fight that is marxism and reject classredictionism if you dont support class reductionism good but some do we need this realitycheck pronto against very wealthy interests trying to convince the workingclass otherwiseto dismiss it as a few online is foolish how many times do we need to see fascists artificially inflate take over and flood social media before we treat this as the threat it is the fascist horrorshow this week shows they know how material culture and identity stuff is too so when pushing socialism as the way forward we must say no war but class war means we fight discrimination oligarchs use to divide the workingclass as well not easy but if we dont hold that principle and work to enact it fascists win

2025-01-25 15:51:51,my thoughts on the adl elon musk and what the modern nazi is,"the adl is compromised the moment they declared antizionism to be a slur it became clear to me that they dont care about distinguishing between the oppressed and the oppressors theyve aligned themselves with the same kind of nationalistic intentions that corrupted germany into becoming nazi germany i had hoped they would acknowledge the plight of palestinians who face severe dehumanization instead theyve actively contributed to it its incredibly dangerous for an organization claiming to be the hate police to passively endorse what amounts to a literal genocide

regarding elon musk its important to recognize a common trait among the ultrawealthythey often operate as borderless entities with elon we cant evaluate his intentions solely through the lens of his actions in america hes a nonstate actor operating on the global stage to fully understand his influence we need to examine his actions and opinions abroad and place him within the political spectrum from a comprehensive perspective

for example some people dismissed his awkward gesture as just thatawkward sure it may have been clumsy but that doesnt mean it wasnt a nazi salute 

what people fail to understand is this no one is calling him a nazi just because he likes maga were calling him a nazi because he literally supports the afd a farright german political group rife with actual nazis elon has a history of retweeting and engaging with these individuals on twittera platform he spent 48 billion to acquire seemingly to unban and amplify people like this 

ask yourself what is a literal nazi in the most honest sense a literal nazi is a german nationalistsomeone who believes in a german identity and that people who dont share this identity dont belong within germanys borders modern german nazis dont hate jewish people the way the old nazis did primarily because jewish people now have a homeland in israel historically hitlers initial intention wasnt to kill jews but to deport them when he couldnt find an economically viable way to relocate them he turned to genocide in the modern era nazis dont want to kill jewsthey want them to leave and go to israel zionism from their perspective solves what they see as a homelessness issue 

but who poses a problem to german nationalists now muslims and palestiniansessentially all arabsdue to racism palestinians displaced from their lands are now a stateless people and modern european nazis see this as a problem the afd in germany is essentially just the nazi party rebranded theyre less hostile toward jews but that doesnt mean they like them jews simply dont pose the same roadblocks to their agenda as they once did

so when elon tweets apparently im a nazi and a zionist  he means it quite literally if you want a world where people stick to their nationality you would support zionism modern nazis arent exclusively hateful toward jewstheyre hateful toward anyone who exists where they dont belong palestinians in their eyes dont belong anywhere

so finally what is a modern american nazi

it would be the same concept nationalism if someone had an idea for that the american identity is and wanted measures put in place that enforce this identity it would count in america its my belief that the mass deportation of immigrants mirrors nazi ideas currently maga is focausing their attention on illigal immigrants its my prediction that in the future what we need to watch for is the stripping of the legal status of immigrants i believe trump is going to propagandize his deportation of criminal illigal immigrants we are going to hear many storys about the gang members he is deporting and he will use this as a polarizing mechanism to potentially gain support for what will be more chilling examples of deportation in the future however an american nazi obviously doesnt care about the state of germany therefore they are not litteral nazis they are neonazis it is my belief that maga is quite litterally the party of american neonazis the kicker is that the adverage american is so ideologically blind that they arent typically ideologically committed to nationalism like musk trump or other rich nonstate actors seem to be the adverage maga supporter is a neonazi through sheer ignorance they dont label themselves as such and they litterally have no idea what they are

if you are a nonstate actornationalist like elon even though you are not american you would still support the act of putting people back where they belong mass deportation is nazi shit elon is a rich south african apartide supporter which is how the modern nazi would manifest

2025-01-25 15:04:11,reflection on christian experience,"ive seen some posts calling out christians in a usa context it may apply abroad  specifically how in todays time evangelical christians often group together on the rightwing side of politics  

this is long see closing thoughts for tldr

of course and many who take time to understand the bible and the gospel will understand that jesus was really proclaiming peace and selfless love for others  this lies in opposition to the evangelical of today who cares about class identity hierarchy tradition and power consolidation 

i am still new to socialism and my overall leftist ideologies so please critique and point out logical fallacies if present  

here is a short story of an experience i had on a mission trip that i feel sums up todays disparity between followers of jesus words and modern day christians  i hope you enjoy 

a little story

lcms years ago i went on a mission trip with a church group to a different state  halfway through the trip we had an evening service at the hq church the sermon that evening was focused on john 13  when jesus washed the disciples feet  would recommend reading it if anyone hasnt 

the pastor stops reading after a few chapters in he kicks a clear tub of bright orange towels out from behind the lectern and announces alright everyone go into your groups and wash someones feet 

the very second he closes his lips a laughter erupts from each and every preteen to high school senior  they all thought washing feet was funny unserious crass  the grief i feel in that moment was immeasurable  over and over i thought to myself arent we supposed to be christians mostly everyone here was affiliated with an lcms school or church 

myself and 3 others in that room were the few that were not caucasian  i did not go to private christian schools like everyone else had  look only a few generations back and youll see my greatgreatgrandmother as a slave in the south  the complexity and dreadful irony i felt will never leave my memory 

in my group i chose to wash a mid 40 year old womans feet because i assumed that someone older would take this seriously i went ahead and washed trying to stay focused on jesus message from john 13  what was supposed to be a beautiful moment of reflection and study was now of shame and nearcringe

afterwards we were directed by the pastor to meet in our group rooms to have our evening talk which was routine  i sat myself at the head of a long office table as all group members filter in  my group leader starts highsandlows what was the high of your day and what was the low 

at my turn i paraphrasing from memory expressed that i had no high for today  i told them all how ashamed and hurt i was that i came all this way wanting to serve others and grow in faith just to have other self proclaimed christians laugh at the very same text that i set my full intentional faith in  my heart was heavy as stone i began to sob  

in this moment of pain i pondered on jesus  how did jesus feel when he wept the savior of humanity being rejected by his own people luke 19  

abruptly i stopped crying my sorrow quickly became joy  a wind of peace and assurance blew over my body telling me this is what its about  true unconditional love for your neighbors is jesus ethos  to this day i believe the holy spirit was with me during this time  never in my life was i so joyful almost hysterically  i finally got it  

for the rest of the trip i worked even harder than before handing out food to homeless tending coop produce and trying to uplift those cast aside by society some other people told me they noticed a change while others stayed the same 

closing thoughts  

i learned that being a christian in practice is about rather than solely identifying as christian to get into heaven  for my life its about loving others helping the those in need and being active  what good is faith if you aint doing shit with it i see many parallels with my conclusion and forms of socialism",No-Edge-8600,socialism,8,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i9ot0d/reflection_on_christian_experience/

but the truth is that affirmative action is an essential tool developed to uproot the system of racist dictatorship that governed the united states until the civil rights revolution of the 1950s and 60s with his latest executive orders trumps hopes to put the last nail in the coffin of affirmative action after a decadeslong campaign that played out under both democrat and republican administrations

2025-01-24 20:52:01,should i support the private healthcare system as a socialist and med student,"i know this might sound bad but hear me out in spain theres a proposal to force medical graduates to work in public healthcare for five years before they can join the private sector while i fully support universal public healthcare and think private healthcare should ideally be abolished the current reality is far from ideal 

public healthcare workers in spain are increasingly exploiteddoctors work some of the longest hours in europe for some of the lowest wages many are leaving the public system for private jobs to escape these conditions forcing doctors to stay in the public sector for five years wont solve the problem instead it could worsen things by reducing the governments incentive to improve working conditions pushing even more doctors to leave the country altogether

i think the existence of the private system pressures the government to retain talent in the public sector by improving working conditions what do you think is my reasoning flawed

2025-01-24 07:45:15,in usa lumpens are more drawn to revolutionary theory and praxis than average workers,"i continously get hate from other marxists for this claim and living by it to the point where ive been insulted told to leave spaces or generally removed from certain marxist platforms on and offline i will continue preaching it nonetheless in the american context lumpenproletariat simply means the most disaffected of workers and it often has colonial and racial undertones lets explain lumpenproletariat are workers or ex workers they are often the lowest of the working class often in urban areas generally are unwilling to work unable to work or out of work or underemployed 

much of the traditional criminal activity associated with lumpenproletariat is also something a lot of workers take part in many workers in the state of americas modern economy have likely had the lumpen experience guys in my union get locked up all the time just looking to make money to work less these tend to be the members of the working class who are most willing to embrace revolutionary thought and praxis because they hold a certain disgust for wage systems and they have an understanding and skillset of street smarts that is needed when engaged in a class struggle average workers dont generally hold these skills because their lifestyles dont require them for survival 

the lumpen elements of the proletariate often gain a certain type of class consciousness in their direct experience of the lack of free will slavery inherent in wage systems when they find themselves outside the realm of renting themselves for said labor though in a larger sense lumpens can often end up holding a parasitic relationship with those around them their communities eachother  this is usually changed through them developing revolutionary praxis 

they are the most ready to fight if they are not fighting on the side of the revolution they will be fighting against it consider the biggest recruiting grounds for hardlined neo nazi groups has for decades been white working class areas with high unemployment rates also consider the mass of lumpen youth who are seen on news daily shootings brazzenly killing their own these examples are both the result of the lumpenproletariat losing revolutuonary praxis after cointelpro the lumpenproletariat should be able to play an extremely important part in revolutionary struggle because they are the only group to combine this potentiality for heroism with an intimate daily knowledge of how to cope with the police and to engage in underground activities as a way of life

the current revolutionary task at hand in north america involves linking and then uniting the struggles of the lumpenproletariat and the working class this is not only essential but needs the work of conscious revolutionaries which is why i praised anarchist networks for helping coordinate and organize prison strikes with the founding of the iwoc incarcerated workers organizing committe 
 2016   2018

the black panther party has shown the way to unite lumpenproletariat with working class by constantly developing practical programs to serve the people in areas where the oppression of the lumpen proletariat is an extreme form of oppression suffered by working people beginning with a base almost entirely within the lumpenproletariat and committed to defending the people against police brutality the panthers now had gained wide support among black workers and thanks to the breakfast for children program throughout the black community what has been central to this success has been the panthers refusal to take the opportunistic course of organizing around lumpenproletarian demands per se but rather organizing through the lumpenproletariat as the most victimized members of the black nation and therefore as ones capable of raising demands for the people as a whole this can be applied to all the communities of disaffected workers in america in all their varying diverse nature

the lumpenproletariat is a class that has received extremely little attention in classical marxistleninist theory and what has been said about it is somewhat puzzling lets divorce from that in spite of all the cointelpro historically waged against such efforts",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,40,217,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i8qbh8/in_usa_lumpens_are_more_drawn_to_revolutionary/

usually people immigrate because theyre desperate and its easy for a capitalist to take advantage of a desperate person because desperate people will work and accept whatever wage they can get

take hispanics for instance they migrate to the us and do work for shit pay and they dont even seem to care too much about it especially considering the union membership rate for hispanics is a whopping 9

or take indians as another example brought over in droves on h1b visas to work for cheap wages for your favorite person in the world elon musk 

so whats up with that are communists and socialists sure they have it right on immigration and open border policy theory because i feel like capitalists are laughing all the way to the bank as we embrace a melting pot society of diversityand we have been embracing a melting pot society for a long time here in the us

this is my first official post in this community hello to all i am peter and i am radical marxistleninist

in recent days there is a war like situation looming over my country slovakia protesters under international corporations with proliberal capitalist forces the greater evil of opposition plan presumably from my research on friday organise massive coup dtat on social democratic government currently in charge lesser evil yes both are capitalist but the oppositions plan is to illegalize socialism while current government has prosocialism china etc  leanings

with this post i would like to warn international socialist movement many of which i know support the vile coup to not budge in with the coupists this coup would inrevertably put slovakia under direct strings of nato brussels and usa government less freedoms more warmongers more hateful approach towards china vietnam nort korea cuba and even its own citizens i am no ficos true supporter but i do use magic of common sense to see that liberal progressive and all pro imperialist and capitalist government would make an end to me my ideals and my dreams while fico is only symbolically prowest during this time i was attending few socialist meetings but opposition wants to make an end to it

fico was chosen democratically in votes opposition lost and from that moment onwards they were lecturing us trough media how to strike how to preserve european union how to destroy east and how to be hateful to china russia africa india all that do not do as they say

we may not be liking fico but we cant let turbocapitalists led by simecka get in charge not again not ever they are threat to socialism in slovakia threat to socialism in europe hungary serbia slovakia are forts for free thinkers dreamers and leftists for now even if with pauses or some dark clouds but they are still more free

 dont let it happen

i hope i said it clearly i hope international socialist communist and other leftists leaning people will share the idea as well i hope for polite conversation

and no unfortunatelly socialism is so low supported in common populace in 2025 that seizing the chaos to establish socialism would hardly work i have met many people who are stuck mentally with totalitarianist communism and cant see socialism differently which is a shame",One-Firefighter-6367,socialism,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i87eys/greetings_first_post_describing_troubles_someone/

the racistfarright militias who took part in that attempted coup and the white supremacist police forces who occupy black neighborhoods are all united under the extremeright racist agenda trumps return represents

even if most people are only learning arguing with each other or discussing a complete revolution i wanted to remind everyone this is a good thing looking for solution is admitting the current system has a problem an infected sickness that has turning the dying empire into a rotten corpse on life support its admission 

socialism or the cword have been erased and frowned upon since before most of us were born and are only now wondering why socialist youtube channels are booming with people including republicans and veterans voicing support look at second thoughts channel it had 15 million subs last month 

for the next coming months or years well see more prorevolution videos and its important to note this happened in 2016 to no fruition but this time the wealth gap broken promises and fake distractions arent working out too well for the system the symptoms of this sickened only have so much medication they can jam down the public to stay sedated im simply curious if this thing was serious which i hope many of us are violence or nonviolent 

how do we get everyone to agree that this capitalist system simply cant be patched and call it a day but instead a complete restructure from every single level

according to fema over 1600 of our community members were made ineligible for transitional sheltering assistance tsa because they were unable to get in contact with them by phone text or email fema made these families homeless in the freezing winter 

yet fema knew exactly were these people were staying and could have easily went and knocked on their doors directly many fema voucher holders have told us that fema has the wrong contact information for them others no longer have a working phone and some have tried repeatedly to call fema  only to be kept on hold for hours

if community volunteers can go door to door and find out our community members needs why cant fema use its billions of dollars in tax money to do the same

2025-01-21 04:21:18,mutual aid doesnt build workingclass power  its 21st century utopianism,"with the new trump term i am seeing a lot of posts online everywhere about mutual aid i wanted to give a warning and word of advice that too often mutual aid devolves from anything political in character to what is essentially charity work charity work 1 does not build power and often 2 cements an alienated serverserved relationship between organizers and those they are helping 

what we need is the oppositewe need to talk issues with our co workers and neighbors get them to take action around issues with us together and get them politically engaged and developing their own sense of class and class power in the us consciousness is built through collective struggle it is when people sign a petition with all of their neighbors in an apartment building calling for the rusty stairs to be fixed it is when workers walk out together away from unsafe conditions and it is when community members crowd city council meetings to oppose local police surveillance measures that consciousness is built because these moments are when the ruling class and their state pushes back against us the most and it is when people see the system fighting so hard against very reasonable democratically organized and massively popular demands that they are radicalized 

mutual aidcharity work doesnt push people to act or struggle and doesnt expose them to the ridiculous power the state wields to crush any attempts they make to gain local power together it just helps them survive another day when we give out food or coats and people take it and maybe also your pamphlets about socialism do they join the struggle are they taking charge of their own circumstances and fighting collectively with others no they go home and try to live another day because charity work individualizes collective problems it doesnt build the kinds of relationships based around issues that we need to build to move our class to act simply put mutual aid places us on the defensive when we need to be going on the offensive 

i want you all to remember the last trump term from 20172021 during the first trump term and then into covid many of us developed and ran local mutual aid projects in our communities at our food distros coat drives and immigrant rights eventsin our lgbtq socials and blackandbrown only eventsin our womens support groups and joy spreading events we were being prefigurative we werent changing the world we were pretending briefly it was something different than it was in the hopes that if we did so enough if would somehow become a reality the bankrupt principle that helping your neighbor one day here or there can somehow challenge whole systems with huge armed bodies of people at their disposal is ludicrous it is utopian it is no different than the st simonians or owenites of the 19th century who hoped that by establishing little communes here and their they could change the world one village at a time

i have been there and fallen for it many times for years during the first trump term i helped organize mutual aid of all kinds cooking full meals from scavanged produce or baked goods that would otherwise be thrown away raising money for needy families and even helping do their laundry i gave generously to our local homeless population whenever i could and tried to help establish a housing first policy in our local continuum of care i too have felt the true joy and imaginative wonder that comes when you hand the plastic bag of food or suppies to needy hands but it is all fleeting its momentary and ephemeral and inchoate and fades fast why because it doesnt build any power after the homeless man takes the food or the needy mother picks up the backpack of school supplies the system remains fundamentally unchallenged and could not care less 

mark my wordsif mutual aid made a difference then the state would try harder to oppose it we would have all landed in jail 

am i saying not to help your neighbors of course not nor am i saying that to assist your communities through the coming mass deportations for example is a totally bankrupt project we must help each other where we can and share what we do have living humbly

what i am saying though is that whatever we do we need to ask how is this building workingclass power right now if your work isnt building relationships between workers developing class onsciousness of the capitalist system and building the kinds of organizationsnetworks of peope and leaders who can successfully call upon people to show up to confrontational actionsthen you arent building power and most of the time mutual aid does none of these things there is nothing mutual about it its a onewaystreet from the hands of your tired volunteers to the desperate and isolated mouths you are feeding

if you want to hand out food coats or backpacks remember that you should have a thirty minute oneonone conversation about the issues with each person you give them to you should ask broad open ended questions get to know them get them talking 80 and you only 20 get them to tell you how they feel about life and the issues they face and ask them what would it mean to you if x issues were gone if you didnt have to worry about making rent or your med or student debt only once you get them to visualize those changes in their heads and trust you then you can paint the vision explain that we dont have to live this way that working people in other countries organized and unionized and won big and we can too but it takes lots of us that numbers is all our class has and then ask them a simple task right then and there to talk to one neighbor or co worker and get them to come to the next event or sign the petition have them call or text that person right there in front of you workshop what to say with them watch them make the call and give them feedback right away then give them another task and set up a dedicated follow up time no more than 4 days from now congratulations you just recruited a new organizer this is how you build power

remember marxists arent utopians we arent into prefigurative politics our theory of change is not if we start practicing mutualism it will eventually change the world our theory of change is instead that only through directly organizing with each other to build powerpower here meaning getting people to turn out in the streets and on the job site to increasingly high stakes political events and answer increasingly high stakes asks from signing petitions down to general strikescan we change the world 

edit i think many people read this post as me saying screw your neighbors and anyone who does mutual aid is dumb when what i did my best to express was the idea that mutual aid projects tend to devolve into circular burnouts that dont generate new organizers or grow the movement in other words theyre often not sustainable because they dont grow new organizers and therefore dont build any power i am trying to model the way out of this those pointing to successful mutual aid movements in the commentsall of your examples were successful in part because of what i wrote they were about relationship building and networking to build power among workers through a series of asks rather than being about charity alone is charity alone a good thing of course it is it is charity it is by definition a good thing but confusing charity with organizing and equating the two overlapping but nonequivalent terms is something we must be cautious of charity alone without any organizing is prefigurative politics and as socialists we should spend our limited time and resources involving organizing convos in everything we do i saw very little of that from myself included bc i didnt know what i was doing during trump 1",DerElrkonig,socialism,53,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i6aecf/mutual_aid_doesnt_build_workingclass_power_its/

these evictions are an outrage helene destroyed more than 100000 homes so people have nowhere to go instead of creating loopholes to force people out of the tsa program and into homelessness fema should issue a blanket extension which allows displaced people to stay housed until they secure more permanent housing

communism will work legally and openly where it can but it will work illegally and secretly where it must the subversive aspects are there to direct the culture of the nation then theres a militant aspects which involves demonstrations riots insurrection and rebellion police must have a capability of dealing with both the subversive and militant aspects

the communists have exerted serious effort to sap the morale of police forces there is always an invisible permanent cadre of hardcore activists seperate groups perform different functions 

as a group policing agencies and police are among the most anti communist of the professional organizations in the free world there is a natural antipathy between police and communists properly armed with knowledge of techniques of communist subversion the communists would never get past the police if we are vigilant if we are alert communism will never take root in the free world the fbi have demonstrated this time and time again

 food is key providing food has historically been a foundation for movements that gained mass support a network that ensures access to food while fostering connections through pantry swaps potlucks and shared gardening there could be a stepping stone for greater action
 class consciousness is growing economic crises naturally increase awareness of systemic inequality even if people dont yet connect it to socialism or collective action this is an opportunity to unite across divisions
 universal goals unite us goals like a 15 minimum wage paid family leave and universal healthcare resonate with a broad base starting with these tangible nonconfrontational goals could build momentum
 storytelling and education matter humor subtle commentary and relatable storytelling can plant the seeds of dangerous ideas in peoples minds even in spaces where direct confrontation wont work

at the same time there are hurdles

 the perception that improving conditions for the most marginalized wont benefit everyone
 a lack of social support among workers and a sense of isolation in the fight for change
 barriers like landlord cooperation automated systems for sustainability and ensuring fairness in any collective system

so i ask you

1 how can we build networks starting with food and community to create a foundation for broader solidarity and action
2 what strategies have you seen work to increase class consciousness and break through divisive narratives like i earned it they didnt
3 how do we unite existing activist groups or individuals who share goals but feel disconnected
4 what would your rally cry or unifying slogan for this movement be

however recently we were talking about future prospects dream jobs and hope for making an impact on the world and he mentioned that he would love to work on fighter jets eventually he has an engineering degree i didnt comment at the time because i didnt think i would say anything smart at that moment but the topic was brought up later again 

we talked and he really could not care less about the moral implications of contributing to the industry of making military equipment and therefore participating in wars and genocide even if indirectly like if its not him it will be someone else but in my opinion all the fucked up things happen in the world because of that sort of thinking the feigned ignorance the plausible deniability wouldnt it be great if there were next to none engineers willing to create weapons of mass destruction obviously its wishful thinking but doesnt the change start with every single one of us and he listened to all of that and isnt bothered in the very least weirdly a person who is not sociopathic and is very much rather empathetic to others suffering

we need to start talking strategy in the wake of the tiktok debacle leading into inaugeration 

the reality of what just happened is about money the ban was never going to be a ban it was not trumps idea and it was not bidens idea zuckerberg brought this to trump in 2019

this was all a bunch of political theater organized by zuck he bought both sides of the aisle and has had them carry this whole charade on when we cant afford bread the time for circuses is over it is vital that we boycott meta to hurt the congresspeople so delete tiktok it will likely be back in a few days as a tool of alt right recruitment 

im not sure how to best go about this but ive been organizing with some folks on red note and we need to start talking strategy 

right now i think the right is counting on one of us to jump the gun and try violent resistance it will give them an excuse to call emergency powers and declare martial law

we cannot let that happen
there may be a false flag attack in the works to accomplish that aim i heard something about geofencing for private drones being disabled they may claim that a someone tried to do something with a drone and use that as their excuse

the historical precedent is that emergencies lead to power grabs by the new regime

if it comes to a point where we are reacting to violence that is fine but we cannot be the ones to initiate it 

to resist the oligarchs we need to operate on 3 pillars
1 community resiliency do not support corporations where possible buy from farmers markets etc

2 collective action we need to organize mass striking coordinated across multiple industries to grind the economy to a halt stop paying your taxes where possible 

3 sabotage clog up the processes of industry break machinery do whatever you can think of short of blowing things up at first

just do not start making plans for violent preemptive strikes that is a game that they will win everytime

im writing this in a hurry so sorry for any bad phrasing or weird stuff just please please please think about this and
 spread the word if you see people wanting to organize attacks in any of your circles we only get one shot at this

edit just to further clarify what ive been able to gather about the sale itself

zuckerberg met privately with trump in 2019 to bring this up the plan was never to ban tiktok it was always for meta to buy it why


1 money  obviously zuck cant stand not owning the hot new platform


2 intelligence gathering  apparently most countries apps use an encryption standard the nsa has a backdoor to guess who is one of the few countries that didnt adopt that standard china our politicians said it was about chinas access to the data when it was really about our spies inability to access it 


3 narrative control  again obviously when the app comes back on in a few days it will be a different vibe delete it if you havent already


4 and the most egregious reason of all zuckerberg set records for how much he lobbied for the ban in 2024 there were articles about this dozens of members of congress also have meta stock 



the fact that one man can buy our government like this for their shared interests of his profit and their ability to keep their citizens in the dark is bleak alarm bells should be going off this administration hasnt even started yet and this is what were dealing with


edit 2



i put together a compilation of the videos i saved before the app went dark yesterday share it to anyone who needs that last push to start organizing

i have been following their campaign for a few months and am coming here to request additional support myself and others in my local community have been trying to raise awareness and fundraise for them on platforms like instagram but their campaigns continue to receive little support

as the ceasefire takes effect on jan 19 feras and lamees want to travel back to their home and salvage what they can to begin rebuilding their lives i have been talking to feras and lamees and have verified their identities on a personal basis and i am a bit desperate to find help for them at this point i hope this post can receive traction and support to help my friends travel back to their homes and begin fulfilling their dreams of going back to school to escape this horrible war

2025-01-18 19:28:44,looking for ideas how can we unite 12 million people for change,"ive spent my life witnessing and living the consequences of wealth inequality as someone who was homeless from 16 to 20 ive seen firsthand how broken our system is and i cant help but feel were long overdue for radical change

in the us billionaires hoard unimaginable wealth while millions of people struggle to afford basic necessities its not just unfairits unsustainable i believe we need to dismantle the systems that allow this level of inequality to persist

heres something ive been thinking about history shows that it doesnt take a majority to create change if just 3 of the population around 12 million people in the us were to protest in a meaningful sustained way we could see real transformation the question is how do we unite people for this kind of action

i know many of us feel powerless against a system so deeply entrenched but i believe theres power in unity and in sharing our lived experiences for me talking openly about my struggles has helped challenge the belief systems that keep us divided its also helped me connect with others who share a similar vision for a fairer more equitable world

so im asking you

 what steps can we take to unite people around the fight for systemic change
 what successful actions or movements have you seen or been part of that we can learn from
 how can we build momentum together even if were starting small

2025-01-18 14:37:04,my thoughts on how capitalism has perverted psychology,"i majored in psychology with a minor in sociology and anthropology because i had a sincere interest in social and behavioral psychology i found it fascinating but then i learned about consumer and industrial psychology the ways the principles i loved studying were ultimately being used to trick people into buying things they dont need or to push workers into giving maximum effort for minimal reward i realized that the main applications of the fields i wanted to pursue were being directed toward aiding big businesses in predatory practices that disillusionment led me to switch gears and pursue nursing instead now one point my professor strived to drive home about consumerindustrial psychology is that it simply provided neutral tools that could be wielded for good or bad but by just applying marxist analysis its clear to me how profit motive ensures that intent overwhelmingly skews toward exploitation for example think of how targeted ads and productivity apps push consumerism and overwork often disguised as helpful innovations ideas like gig economy apps social media algorithms or workplace surveillance tactics are all instances of exploit psychology at work

but it still haunts me i know for a fact there are altruistic healing applications for what weve learned in psychology but under capitalism profit motive warps everything the potential to genuinely help people through social psychology has been perverted the world would be a much better place if we could simply adjust societal norms to relieve some of the unnecessary stress people endure instead in a capitalist society stress is deliberately manufactured to force productivity this is baked into the education system itself and i want to specify stress exists in all forms of society in some manner but in capitalism it is very intentionally used against you

from an early age were taught that falling behind on work will always lead to more stress over time this conditioning creates an automatic fear response at the thought of failure when those students enter the workforce the same lessons are reinforced through the constant pressure of monetary deadlines debt and the threat of financial instability this cycle ensures that workingclass people are always rushing to meet some due date unable to escape the grind  

this practice of turning people into obedient workers has roots much deeper than most realize during colonization one of the first tactics white settlers used to dominate indigenous people was education they came to tribal societies armed with aweinspiring knowledge of the broader world and promised modernization to help the tribes prosper but the first lesson they taught was to abandon traditional practices and embrace the socalled virtues of labor  

this had a devastating twofold effect tribal societies already had systems of education though they were rooted in traditionteaching history and values through dances stories and rituals by abandoning these traditions for westernstyle education they lost their stories and with them their cultural memory when a people are stripped of their history theyre also denied a legitimate claim to the present colonialism offers one of the clearest examples of how erasing history is central to power and domination while modern education introduced technological advancements it came at the cost of indigenous knowledge systems selfdetermination and identity many traditions were dismissed as primitive rather than being integrated into modern frameworks the result was cultural erasure and economic dependency not empowerment

and then you look at modern america and you see echoes of this most americans cant describe what their greatgreatgrandparents did or believed were encouraged to focus on our immediate nuclear families but the average citizen only has ties to about two generations of their past our society is structured so that were all essentially clean slates ripe for generational manipulation

the evidence is clear the systems weve built dont exist to serve humanitythey exist to serve profit and control psychology and education should be tools for empowerment not exploitation to create a better world we must dismantle these systems harmful structures and reimagine their potential for healing equity and connection",SadPandaFromHell,socialism,50,515,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i48ub0/my_thoughts_on_how_capitalism_has_perverted/

2025-01-18 00:55:06,how to talk to people who are misinformed about what they believe,"hey guys im flairing this post as activism as it deals with educating people who may just be sympathetic to socialist ideas even if they dont nessacarily know they are sympathetic to those ideas this is a long one so be prepared 

for some background the person who i wad talking to way my mother the person who has always been there for me and who i could always rely on shes mostly apolitical but come around 2016 she voted for trump come again 2020 and 2024 she voted for trump again why does she vote for trump you may ask well i asked her and she said that he promises to make things more affordable things the way they were 4 or 5 years ago i asked how she thinks this will happen how one man can dictate the prices of goods in a free market capitalist society she tells me that she doesnt know i ask why would you vote for someone that you dont know how theyll do the things theyll promise to do and then she smiled and said ha look at you being smart 

this was the beginning of talking to her about what she wants a more free and fair society we talked about things that were important to her one of those things being criminal justice and that criminals being punished for their wrong doings i asked her what the most common reason someone goes to prison murder rape theft no drug use drug use is the most common reason people go to prison at least in the united states i asked her if people should be punished for drug or is they should instead be rehabilitated and get the help they need she agreed so among the things that were important to her she wanted to see that the welfare system was reformed and that people can have access to some sort of healthcare she even mentions about having some people need different types of healthcare according to their needs 

the last thing we talked about was workplace democracy being able to support yourself thriugh your contribution and how the owner ultimately does nothing to contribute to society  that what ultimately gets things  are workers  and that owners are middlemen that get in the way i asked her what she didnt like about her workplace what she could change if she could for some extra context my mother is a manager at a lab who makes 70000 year quite a bit of money enough for a decent life but even nowand then we still have the occasional hiccup what separates her from other managers is that she does genuinely care about her team she genuinely cares about what they feel and whatever problems theyre dealing with she helps then get things done her team only makes 30000 a year and with what she tells me people are struggling one guy for example has to pay a lot of gas money to get to his job as we all know gas is not cheap other managers dont care about their and job or their staff they only care about their paycheck which i can understand but you have a responsibility to uphold to your fellow workers who expect you to do your job to maximize results and to the peoples samples youre testing she mostly tests samples i asked her what could be done to fix this and if there are better people who  are fit being managers she says that she was the only manager and that everyone else could grieve their frustrations to her to make for a more productive and satisfying work environment i asked if she thought that workplace democracy was a good idea and she says that she would agree with that 

so whats to take away from this conversation well its to always be mindful of people do truly have good hearts who have the best intentions talking with these people is a good way to help break down the propaganda that they have been fed through various media if everyone one of is were to have a conversation like this we can build a better world truly

as always i love you all and please stay safe the worst has yet to come if you have any questions please ask",Peespleaplease,socialism,4,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i3vp3i/how_to_talk_to_people_who_are_misinformed_about/

2025-01-16 23:24:33,questions on how to speak to liberal family member about china,"this is a personal and rather specific question but i felt i could use some help here and maybe this conversation could help others in similar situations

ive just recently had a conversation with one of my parents about how interesting its been to converse with actual chinese citizens or i dont know if i should call it a conversation because i was only able to talk about one exchange ive had with someone online before my parent began criticizing and railing against the chinese government

now admittedly i am not very educated on china this is why i found it very enlightening to speak to a few people from there but i was kind of appalled at what my parent had to say when i said that the chinese user i was speaking to was surprised by how much we work over here in the united states my parent essentially said that while china has apparently lifted people out of poverty which is what i said my parent added the apparently theyve only done so because they want to appear like they care for the people on the world stage and so they could prevent revolt from within because everyone there used to be poor

i found these points difficult to combat against because they are assumptions of intent i tried to say that if they have only done good things for their populace for the aesthetics of it then they have failed because most of the western world has a very low view of china i also said that regardless of the intent improving the lives of its people should be regarded as a good thing and pointed out that the american people are in need of help and government intervention and that we are at the point where many people feel like revolting and instead our government is doubling down on their oligarchy amp tripling down on their refusal to help the american people this basically got no response

additionally my parent brought up that china is allied with all evil nations again not my quote lol like russia north korea amp saudi arabia to create their own currency so that our sanctions do nothing to them and they can do the evil things they do this was appalling to me as well and i didnt know what to say other than pointing out that we have created our own currency that we use to hold the world and specifically the global south hostage so that we may enable our pillaging and genocides i asked what evil things and my parent essentially said they want to control the world

my parent as well said that you might be able to work there and make a nice living there but theyd make you do it in a way that us as americans probably wouldnt want to do i dont even know what that means i found it too vague to actually address 

i guess i am asking for more help on how to combat those specific points and also maybe some tips on how to deal with your family being like this i found it really disheartening to hear this stuff especially the last two paragraphs i wrote it feels so explicitly racist i dont even know how to approach it evil nations who want to control the world so they can do evil things make a living but not how americans like to these are such abstract accusations i do not know how to address them

the netherlands has had a problem with companies like shell and asml threatening to pull out of the country if certain laws and policy changes are pushed through

right now a person can move or be born in the netherlands enjoy an education start a company with tons of government benefits make a fortune using infrastructure created by the government often times get tax breaks and help from the governments if theyre struggling loan money from dutch banks protected by the government etc 
this is all paid for with taxes from the dutch people and then theyd just up and leave taking a shit ton of money out of the economy with them

this is like moving in with someone paying the bare minimum in rent while ravaging through their fridge leeching off their netflix using their internet and electricity services maybe even using their pc every once in a while for years 
then once youve saved up enough for your own place and they ask you hey could you pay the grocery bill for once you threaten to move and when they in response put a lock on the fridge you just get up and leave without saying thank you once

this is how you get an elite rich and companies that just take and take then threaten to take their assets elsewhere if a government does anything that they dont like

its temping to want the change now to lift our voices up and have all the bad done away with in one motion never to be seen again but any change any revolution takes time i use the world revolution purposefully for revolutions seem to be powerderkegs that eventually one spark will ignite the blast that will send the fascists racists capitalists running but it is rarely ever that way instead imagine it like a fire one that must be fed and stoked over time 

once i realized this fact i realized that i could make a difference from anywhere as long as i stoked the fire as long as we add fuel to the flame we will continue to grow and much like a fire its often when its too big to control that anyone takes notice of its power 

so what now we take our time we wait we stoked the flames where ever we see an opportunity we either educate or fire up those who want change we must follow the lead of our opposition they took their time they waited and planned and spread their propaganda and lies until anyone who wasnt on a side followed their lead we need to take that momentum back

the anarchist collectives also sat before the assembly and urged people to occupy beyond here occupy all buildings our work places do not stop short and voted to occupy surrounding abandoned buildings as social centers this series of succesful votes led to the liberals feeling defeated by the anarchists as the police became increasingly violent in response to these votes this video i linked is from the night after that vote you can see their organizing efforts made occupy oakland stand out from some of the other locations",Dazzling-Screen-2479,socialism,1,9,https://youtu.be/tVLc3MmAT0A?si=CYP15TM88tx36sPB
2025-01-15 06:49:54,someone asked me arent nazis and socialists both leftwing i figured id share my response here,"so the nazi party calls themselves national socialists right so what happens is that people hear the word socialist and run with it this is litterally what the nazis hoped you would do

the national part people ignore is actually where the context of their beliefs lie the nazis were nationalists so what is nationalism nationalism is a political ideology centered on promoting the interests culture and identity of a specific nation often prioritizing it above others this includes exclusion based on race religion and politics for example hitler believed the ideal german had blonde hair and blue eyes he thought jewish people leftists and a whole long list of other identitys were the opposite of german and needed to be purged from german borders

but wait he killed leftists that makes no sense for a socialist to do well the reason he killed leftists was because germany had a strong leftist party during ww1 and he blamed them for loosing the war in fact hitler hated leftists but he did find success in populism this brings me to fascism fascism is practically the result of antisocialist philosophers trying to create a ideology that acts as a poison to socialism it takes after a lot of the insights a marxist perspective can give a politically minded person the thing is love him or hate him marxs view on global politics and power dynamics was powerful marx very sussinctly detailed the power structures in play and labeled the source of tension in society as a battle between the working class and the owning class he revealed the immense power of the working class should they unify under one banner in my mind populism is simply the art of speaking to working class people in an attempt to awaken that emmense power its not a bad thing if your intentions are pure like that of a leftist but it is a bad thing if you are a demagogue with bad intentions

fascism seeks to use the same power of populism that marx revealed and redefine the source of tension as highlighted by marx as something else for example convincing the working class that jewish people are the source of tension instead of labeling the owning class as the source and then speaking to unify the working class in their hatred of jewish people would be a form of fascism so does fascism have its roots in marxismsocialism yes but only in the sense that the ideology of fascism used the foundations of marxism and built a perverted and warped version of it from the base of the perspective marx taught us but it should also be noted that in addition to the working class hitler also spoke to landlord and small buisness owners because capital ownership did not bother him

socialism is very strict in its adherence to the idea that the tension will always be the owning class vs the working class it rejects all other hierarchies as a potential source of inequalityexploitation that being said although hitler hated socialists his party still took the name of national socialists as a nod towards their goal of uniting the working class against all identities they vilified this is not leftist

now here is the kicker do you know what other groups have a strong adherence to nationalism the kkk is one the kkk has a definition for the american culture the vilified black and brown people im sure if they somehow found a foothold of power in our political system they would reveal similar fascist tendencies as the nazis

this is why maga is concerning two things are argueably true about trump he is a nationalist with stong ideas about what the american identity should be and who is or is not a real american he has populist tendencies his campaign was aimed towards the rightwing working class as well as landlords and small buisness owners and he is absolutely a demagogue

the same could also be said of benjamin netanyahu this one is nore controversial but i would argue that the way zionism has been playing out is strongly suggestive that israel has nationalist ambitions as well 

finally i ask what is the left vs the right the answer is capitalism to be far left is the belief that capitalism needs to be completely phased out with the ultimate goal if dismantling all hierarchies that can possibly be dismantled leading to pure equality justice freedom and liberty for we the people of the world i am far left i dont think its practical yet but i hope we get there someday to be far right is to believe in an absolutely free market where capitalism can thrive unhindered id argue that this is what anarchistcapitalists believe 

because hitler didnt mind capitalists the nazi party is at the very least rightwing because he believed in a large and very strict social hierarchy id wager that places the nazis and other nationalists further right dont get me wrong either i acknowledge that places like the soviet union were socialists and were also imperfect but i still think socialism is a good idea it has stuggles in the sense that capitalism works to undermine it additionally fascism was an effective poison for socialism but there are very many opinions leftists have about how socialism should be implemented that are hotley debated stalin believed an iron fist was needed to prevent the revolution from being undermined and used authoritarianism to make it so this is called marxistlennonism i argues that there needs to be a strong unwavering and somewhat oppressive socialist state due to the worry that without oppressive tendencies capitalists would rise up and use their wealth to cause corruption 

i consider myself a democratic socialist because i believe that for decades class consciousness has been repressed the working class dont even realize they are working class anymore but i think if we can foster class consciousness in people the power of the working class can once again be used to challenge the power structure within the owning class in a way that will hopefully someday lead to socialism",SadPandaFromHell,socialism,16,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1i1rqpi/someone_asked_me_arent_nazis_and_socialists_both/

2025-01-14 17:10:19,if unemployment is an issue why shouldnt nations prioritise employing its current citizens over relying on economydriven immigration,"just asking this to get an idea of how people here feel about this issue


the current pushback against immigration to the uk often comes in the form of concerns of immigrants poaching economic opportunity from the uks unemployed and homeless population alongside potential racism and xenophobia appear to be questions of what exactly they will do whenin immigrants fulfill the uks employment needs


this made me think back to the postwar consensus lead by socialists like clement attlee and nye bevan in the 1940s where the focus was primarily on keeping britons employed and healthy


what do socialists make of this kind of economic protectionism today is there not a legitimate arguement that nations owe their current citizens a system whereby they can be rehabilitated trained etc to fulfill societys needs as a priority over relying upon immigrant populations to do this


and what is to be done about the remaining unemployed and homeless citizens afterwards if there is no opportunity for them surely they are simply stuck in their predicament without realistic optimism


when we look at trade blocs like the eu they themselves impose protectionist policy in order to make goods produced by eu member states competitve with chinese taiwanese etc products which can be produced and transported much cheaper but at the cost of unethically low pay and poor conditions most people view this as a positive policy


so is there a legitimate arguement here that nations should be protecting the economic prospects of its current citizenry before considering encouraging immigration to said country to fill shortfalls in employment

2025-01-10 02:49:07,how do you balance deep analysis with progress when studying marxist theory,"ive been diving into lenin recently and after reading just 10 pages it took me 4 hours and 30 minutes i found myself compelled to stop and write out a detailed synthesis of my understanding stopping four times in total i had to fully connect his ideas about the state going all the way back to the real start of class systems around 3000 bce with the rise of early state societies in mesopotamia and their transition to feudalism around 500 ce then through the transition to capitalism after the 1400s to see what he meant by the state being oppressive i was initially misguided thinking that a farleft ideology meant a powerful state regulating capitalism so i felt the need to map out the entire historical process just to make sure i understood lenins point properly

this process of deeply engaging with the material questioning my understanding and justifying lenins arguments before continuing felt like it was necessary to make sure the material wasnt just slipping away i even feared that what i was reading could be useless or irrelevant the failure of the ussr kept coming to mind and i had to reconcile that with the notion that lenins work is still valuable especially in the first 10 pages id read even if the historical application didnt align perfectly

this method of pausing synthesizing and reflecting seems to be the way my brain works but its also incredibly timeconsuming and feels almost compulsive i cant move forward without deeply internalizing the material i know it sounds like a good thing to be able to heavily absorb material because it should help me read and internalize marxist theory but it also is annoying to rely on it to enjoy the reading and it seems to fade away when i move on to a new field of books such as how im currently on marxism and am losing touch with plato 

is this kind of intense analysis common among others studying marxism is it a strength i should embrace or am i overthinking things and slowing myself down unnecessarily id appreciate any advice on how to strike a balance between deep reflection and making progress",Adventurous_Ad_2765,socialism,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hxujnn/how_do_you_balance_deep_analysis_with_progress/

we have to play this game that could be so much better if the rules were different but i do not see the rules changing ie from capitalismconsumerism to socialism happening until a majority of people can agree that this system is broken and with the propaganda from the forces that be regarding the benefits of capitalism i do not see a general shift happening anytime soon

so what do you do
how do you plan to not work forever
how do you plan to have children and educate them if that is something you want
how do you plan for a future in this country knowing that your ideals clash with the reality and practicality of where we are now and where we are likely to be in the future

2025-01-09 18:59:07,homelessness is not a sad accident there are criminals behind it  the capitalist class and their socalled free market the same forces that drove massive inflation starting with the covid19 pandemic are at the roots of todays housing crisis,"rhode islands government has systematically failed to address the states homelessness crisis our homelessness rate is sixth highest in the country and worsening the number of calls to the coordinated entry system which helps people access shelters or other housing has almost doubled in the last four years

responding to a cold snap this week progressive providence city counselors and housing activists organized a warming shelter in city hall to keep people from freezing to death on the streets after 54 people living outside died in 2024 alone

why is there a homelessness epidemic in 2020 covid caused millions of people to lose their jobs all at once a phenomenon that naturally snowballed into an eviction crisis when people couldnt pay rent at the same time the wealthy began fleeing the big cities especially new york and many began buying up homes in rhode island by october of 2020 the price of homes in our state had increased a whopping 15 over the previous year and those prices continued to skyrocket 

federal covid relief funds were allocated to help people pay their rents but they were failing abysmally to reach those in need out of millions of dollars and thousands of applications only a few hundred thousand dollars in rent relief had been distributed to about 230 households in september 2020

meanwhile landlords seized on the spiking housing market to buy up new homes raise rents force poorer tenants out in order to renovate and welcome wealthier ones 

forcing the ruling class to solve our problems rather than line their pockets requires people power with a strong movement we could not only provide guaranteed housing to all but create a socialist system that would fix prices raise wages and organize society for the benefit of working people

this article examines lukcss theorisation of the unconsciousnot as a libidinal or instinctual force but as an epistemic and automatising mechanism that influences agents actions the study first addresses the need for marxism to engage with the concept of the unconscious drawing parallels with the psychoanalytic tradition it then considers lukcss conception of the historicity of consciousness and the process of reification that creates unconscious epistemic barriers the paper further explores the potential of the oppressed class to overcome these barriers and highlights strategies for consciousnessraising and transcending the unconscious in lukcss later works by providing a nuanced analysis of the intersection between marxism and the unconscious this article offers new insights into how unconscious processes affect agency and consciousness within a historical and social framework",viodin228,socialism,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hxdq8i/class_epistemic_position_and_collective/

in other words isnt the moral objection to oppression from wage labor and private capital ownership based on value judgements that are as transitory and conditional as the base and superstructures that theyre derived from arent our moral judgements inevitably grown from the soil of capitalism and its superstructures what is the origin of marxist moral value judgements how do we know those values are correct 

we cant just appeal to peoples moral instinct to say wage labor oppression is inherently immoral because many people are influenced by capital to disagree with that statement they would say their moral instinct informs against marxist ethics whats the reasoned explanation for why marxist ethics is correct rather than merely one of many moral perspectives",Capable-Sail-9712,socialism,3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hwb7hq/whats_the_marxist_justification_for_moral/

people are right to want to take on the corrupt ultrarich class that dominates the government and the economy but the policies trump is planning to implement and the people who he is appointing to implement them show that his real agenda is redistribute even more wealth from the bottom to the top

the real goal of trump and the billionaires hes appointed to lead the government is to destroy the historic progress made for working people and find new ways to make huge profits in the ruins of our rights but we can fight back

conventionally with exceptions the red power rangers has fulfilled a leadership role in the series in space the red ranger andros is the omly member of the team who is familiar with the astro mega ship and the mission and therefore takes on assertive role early on

however as the show progresses each of the other rangers takes on a speciality ashley the yellow ranger becomes exceptional at piloting the vessel carlos the black ranger becomes an expert on scanning and sensing technology tj the blue ranger becomes a weapons and field tech expert and cassie the pink ranger focuses on starship maintenance and repair

when each of the rangers has a specialty it becomes a totally democratic organization the astro mega ship has no captain no hierarchy when in battle they listen to each other without issuing commands the person who is most expert on the topic is the person whose opinion is given the most weight

when it comes to strategic or moral decisions its always depicted as a conversation designed to produce a compromise never an ultimatum rangers talk out plans discuss the possible outcomes and work together to come to a conclusion

while the production of power rangers as a franchise as been a capitalist hellscape i think the creatives behind the writing especially have extremely leftist views as to how society should be run and how people should interact with each other like many leftist creatives to make ends meet and send a positive message they had to work within the system

two fbi agents testified that they identified oropesa in winter haven where one of the defaced crisis pregnancy centers antiabortion centers which masquerade as legitimate abortion clinics was located a chief concern regarding this sworn statement is the lack of evidence supporting it no evidence regarding this matter was referred to over the course of the trial furthermore an inconsistency glossed over by the jury was a testimony by a cast cellular analysis survey team fbi agent who stated that tracking evidence does not support the conclusion that oropesas phone was present in winter haven this conflicts with statements alleging that the defendant was present at the site of the antiabortion center

given the sentences imposed by the dishonorable judge virginia covington for the other defendants in this case it is apparent that these trials are being used to make examples of the activists and to strike fear in other floridians protesting the states draconian abortion regulations

beats getting hit with a 50 caliber in the face 

history obviously tells us the answer is yes as many states and leaders have done some cruel things to the opposition but this idea of a full system revolution isnt some protest or strike but rather a combination of both while forcefully overthrowing power or talking capital from those that hold most of it so with unionized classless people coming for you and weapons that have only been used on foreign civilians such as drone strikes to send freedom to our neighbors

2025-01-04 03:01:55,help am i bad at math or missing something engaging with paul matticks permanent crisis,"ive been trying to read up on paul mattick recently and particular his and henryk grossmans theory of crisis

but i feel i am missing something

heres why

i am working from this article 

that article has a table in it which idk how to copy over to a reddit post

anyways i cant get the numbers to match and maybe i am just bad at math or is the table wrong or am i using the wrong equations

ok so working with his assumptions that constant capital grows at 10 per annum variable capital grows at 5 that the rate of exploitation is 100 and we start with 200000 constant and 100000 variable

rate of exploitation is sv if thats 100 then s  v

so our rate of profit for year 1 is scv10000020000010000  333

c grows by 10 so c next year is 220000 and v by 5 so it is 105000

our new rate of profit is therefore 105000220000105000  323 not 326

the other rates of profits sort of work

but then we have c in year 4 if you do 200000111111 you get 266200 not 266000

theres lots of little discrepancies like that in this table so am i just bad at math or is the table flawed

i also dont fully get what formula is being used for a it was avac which gives you 25 at the start but quickly dovetails away and downwards rather than upwards like the table states so what formula is being used there

can someone help me work through the math of this table

i made my own table of what i think it should be here 

i included the formulas i used and all that please help me spot the error if im wrong",[deleted],socialism,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1ht4rh9/help_am_i_bad_at_math_or_missing_something/

2025-01-03 22:57:12,thoughts on the working families party wfp,"in the aftermath of the recent election a lot of folks are rightly asking whats next for party building a floundering strategy has been trying to transform the democratic party from within via progressive candidates in my prediction this will lead to selfdefeating incrementalism

traditional thirdparty alternatives like the green party seem to fail not only because of a rigged twoparty system but a failure to present a winning and viable strategy to most voters basically if the people sniff out performative politics and dont think you can actually get the goods theyre not going to have your back 

i do think the party for socialism and liberation gets a break from this critique because it functions as a revolutionary party that also engages in nonelectoral organizing

that brings me to the working families party beyond their fusionvoting strategy in new york they have an interesting approach of trying to build a thirdparty ontopof the democratic party infrastructure  endorsing slates and functioning as a preparty while it seems to be led by serious and pragmatic organizers their trackrecord doesnt distinguish them from democratsliberals enough for my liking

2025-01-03 09:45:21,this week reports confirmed south koreas intelligence command purchased over 200 dprk north korea military uniforms back in july lawmakers allege yoons plan was to kill those dissenting from martial law and deceive people into thinking the dprk had attacked south korea,"over the last month lawmakers in south korea unveiled new evidence in support of the disturbing allegation that yoon tried to restart the korean war as a pretext for declaring martial law this claim continues to gain traction in south korea as new reports confirm that south koreas intelligence command had purchased over 200 dprk north korea military uniforms back in july 

assembly members are charging that yoons plan was to kill political figures dissenting from martial law and deceive people into thinking the dprk had attacked south korea the allegations also purport that yoons ultimate goal may have been to trigger direct us strikes on north korea

while the full truth has yet to be uncovered these emerging details demonstrate the severity of yoons coup attempt and the dangers posed by the ussouth korea alliance 

the imperialist media claims that north korea is the ultimate threat on the peninsula but it is actually south koreas ruling class and their backers in washington who are most aggressively seeking to restart the korean war the widespread demonization of north korea acts as a kind of smokescreen that obscures the reality of us imperialism in korea

for the us war in korea provides a pathway towards war with china for south koreas ruling class reunifying the peninsula through violent annexation is becoming increasingly necessary to weather the economic and political crisis wrought by the new cold war

as the masses of south korea are currently proviing working people have the power to alter the course of history through organized and collective action us and south korean attempts to trigger war in korea and east asia will not stop with this one attempt as we enter 2025 let us all internalize the importance of becoming politically conscious and organized for the sake of our collective liberation",Prudent_Bug_1350,socialism,4,251,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hsixlz

2025-01-02 05:38:12,can i please get some help understanding why a lower rate of profit causes crisis,"ive been trying to understand marxs theory of crisis for a while now but basically all the articles online either explain the bits i already get or i dont get their wording

here is the fundamental question i want to understand why does the trpf cause a recession

my understanding of the trpf is that competition drives capitalists to substitute more constant capital c for variable capital v ie labor this increases relative surplus value sv but also the organic composition of capital cv

if the rate of profit is scv  svcv1 then if cv1 rises faster than sv you end up with a lower rate of profit the reason that this happens is that surplus value is limited by the absolute mass of it that can be produced in a day which is less limited than the amount of constant capital usable this means that in the long term the rop tends to fall


the next step in the crisis is that the lower rop caused businesses to go under that increases unemployment and drives down v while also removing c from the equation a lower c and a lower v means that the rop goes up again and the cycle continues



heres what i do not understand why does the lower rop cause a business to go under after all arent profits still positive why does just making less profit on each dollar invested mean you go under i can see a lower rop reducing the total mass of investment in the economy sure but why does that mean that businesses themselves go under


fundamentally i dont get why continuous investment is needed to prop up a business why do they have to grow i get that competition forces that but if everyone faces lower rates of profit no one has a competitive advantage so capital cannot go anywhere right

is it because theres less overall investment meaning that some businesses get investment while others dont rendering them uncooperative is that it or what

or is the fundamental problem a crisis of realization capitalists cannot fully utilize overbuilt industry as the market is saturated or is the problem that workers are paid too little to consume their product but doesnt that happen anyways thats the entire point of surplus value right



what is actually causing businesses to go under especially when the rate of profit is still positive 

an inability to service debt or maintenance on existing capital but isnt that already included via c or does c just refer to the value of the machine and not the maintenance and debt needed to finance it as that comes out of profit so a lower rop renders debt and overhead on the old capital rendering it more expensive than it brings in which can drive a business under",[deleted],socialism,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/1hrmrv6/can_i_please_get_some_help_understanding_why_a/

2025-01-02 03:59:30,violence in the irish troubles what did it accomplish,"irishman here i have spent pretty much my entire life in a republican family from the south so i have read studied and learned about the troubles and irish history for a very long time

recently ive been undergoing the political education of socialism and something that i am torn about is violence to my family the violence before during but not after the troubles was a necessary evil i recognize the need to resist oppressors and the underlying concept of the oppressed using violence against oppressors at the same time nonviolence is massively important in many socialist circles even to the point of pacifism

at the moment the way i see the violence in the troubles is that it was for nothing so many innocent people killed by all sides with very little support or mutual aid for communities the worst victim of this conflict was the working class both protestant and catholic i see most leftist circles supporting the ira with little criticism and it is seen as pure heresy to in my family or online 

it seems to me that as soon as anticonflict populist movements came to dominate the civil rights movement in ni both sides came to sign the good friday agreement gfa the conflict did not advance socialist goals it alienated the working class from each other it alienated the islands peoples from each other it drove hatred in britain and ireland alike peace hasnt solved and problem yet but it atleast wasnt a band aid solution

maybe im completely reading this in a biased way but it seems to me that this conflict was no peoples war many groups used it to advantage themselves over the working class politicians governments paramilitaries alike 

so after this probably too long post i ask fellow leftists what is your thoughts on this whether you know or dont know much about it is violence warranted is it also warranted to capitulate our values in support of a war or in support of a peace agreement 

how does this apply to the greater socialist movement around the world where violence has been successfulunsuccessful several people ive talked to reference malcolm x others mlk

the incoming administration is seeking to continue to expand the system of detention and deportation we are mobilizing at the wyatt detention center to demand an end to the ice contract no more beds for ice detention freethemall

while we gather together we will also continue our call for an end to the occupation of palestine and an end to the provision of us weapons and funding to a genocidal state the same technology being tested in gaza and the west bank is being used at the us border with mexico and to surveil activists across the us these issues are inextricably linked

2024-12-31 17:14:29,teaching the horrors of socialism and communism,"if the crucial communism teaching act ever gets signed into law american kids will be forced to discuss socialism and communism in the classroom if that happens i would hope that someone would make some short videos that illustrate the horrors of communism within chinas own borders yes china is still dependent upon market capitalism but the point is to call out the lies and propaganda

communism we know a thing or two about it         

the inner cities are dingy and horrific             
  show a skyline full of colorfully lit skyscrapers                 

the children are mistreated               
  show hundreds of happy kids playing at a modern play yard                

millions go to bed hungry every night           
  show an open market with hundreds of vendors           

it is so crowded it is hard to move around          
  show people relaxing on a bullet train         

they can barely keep the electricity running             
  show a high tech robotic production line            

there is no upward mobility            
  show video of a drone flying through a college campus with students milling about             

it is a dreary and depressing place            
  show off several national parks            

communism is obviously the worst economic system on the planet             
 show some of the museums and other architectural wonders              

this could be replicated for other socialistcommunist countries to show off their progress

the cognitive dissonance and reverse psychology would shock a lot of americans and get them thinking about how theyre being lied to as part of a massive global propaganda scheme would get them wondering about what other lies theyve been fed

2024-12-30 21:41:46,us president jimmy carter has died without facing justice for his role in the gwangju massacre,"in 1980 the people of the south korean city of gwangju rose up against col chun doo hwans declaration of martial law seeking an end to decades of military rule the people of gwangju seized the city and established a peoples government reminiscent of the paris commune

despite its claims to promote freedom and democracy in korea and around the world the us saw the gwangju uprising as a threat to its interests 

chun informed the carter administration of south koreas plans to crush the uprising with military force carters pentagon approved the redeployment of south korean troops from the dmz for this purpose the us also sent an aircraft carrier and reconnaissance aircraft to the vicinity of gwangju during this uprising

activists in gwangju believe as many as 2000 people were killed during the gwangju massacre of may 27 during our delegation to south korea in 2023 we learned that at least 67 families of gwangjus martyrs are still searching for the bodies of their loved ones

the struggle against yoons martial law order in south korea today is an extension of the struggle of gwangjus heroes while formal democracy was won in 1987 real liberation for south koreas working class and the sovereignty of the korean people has not yet been achieved

today the imperialists of the world will celebrate jimmy carter we invite you to join us instead in celebrating the martyrs of gwangjuwhose spirits remain with us in the struggle against imperialism us occupation and capitalism one day the carters of the world will be forgotten but the heroes of gwangju and every martyr in the struggle for liberation will live forever

formed in 1970 the red brigades sought to create a revolutionary state through armed struggle and to remove italy from the north atlantic treaty organization nato the organization attained notoriety in the 1970s and early 1980s with their violent acts of sabotage bank robberies the kneecapping of certain industrialists factory owners bankers and politicians deemed to be exploitative as well as the kidnappings or murders of industrialists prominent capitalists politicians law enforcement officials and other perceived enemies of the workingclass revolution nearly fifty people were killed in its attacks between 1974 and 1988


the initial pics are all kidnapped powerful people that were kidnapped and released after some time by the br im so bummed nobody made an art film on the gang because there so many incredible stories in their autobiographies they had big to moderate support at the start from the workers in big industries in the main cities in italy they were just a group of  young disillusioned people that tried to change things and after some time realized that it was all over their story is a must for who wants to study past armed urban guerrila groups their books are really interesting

a lot of people were expressing to me feelings of loneliness been there nerds

sometimes this manifests on my posts in silly hate comments towards myself or women in general continuous unkind pms  other people just msg me to have a chat and i really appreciate that i love chatting to you all when im up late after work and cant sleep or if theres something on my mind

i was in a very dark place about two years ago and shitposting genuinely helped who knew shooting the shit and ranting about stupid culture war issues with strangers could be so beneficial

i had a very cool catchup and dinner today with a beloved friend of mine and it made me think about how important friendships can be

its easy to become jaded given the world were living in today i bet we could all least about 100 reasons why life is kind of shit at times work is hard university is hard at my lowest moments i think i should keep going because i atleast have use to others we can all volunteer our time  offer a listening ear text someone back make a phonecall to a friend do something unpaid and genuine comfort a stranger

hugs as always fat greasy slobs
please continue to reach out because i appreciate all the friendships i make and conversations i have here  lt3",bhexca,worldpolitics,32,56,https://i.redd.it/992nxgple6ie1.jpeg

2024-12-25 03:26:01,wendy amp lisa feat seal  the closing of the year 1992 enhanced toys ost,"look something pleasant

give an exhale and take ten deep slow breaths any time you feel stressed or anxious

stress is maintained in the body by hormones that are broken down by oxygen and deep breathing brings lots of oxygen into the body

exhale first because trying to inhale while your lungs are full of air can feel like you cant breath which will just stress you out more

count the breaths because counting gets your higher brain functions working and puts you in a more rational stateofmind

imagine the feeling of happiness and focus on it for as long as you can or if you can for as long as you like

feeling happy makes you feel happy and never feeling happy makes you never feel happy

neurons that fire together wire together so if you never let yourself feel happy your brain will eventually make it so that you can never feel happy

let yourself feel happy

imagine the sensation of happiness focus on it let yourself feel the happiness so that you can have a happy xmas",zerooskul,worldpolitics,2,2,https://youtu.be/j-MAqVsOLFI?si=paSbLIkn5v_BgYfR

2024-12-19 02:27:01,why you should buy a bidet,"dear mr redacted
it is with a heavy heart that i contact you today for i must lodge a complaint that has been years in the making

it began in august 2022 when i visited redacted for a certain bachelor party during my stay an unscrupulous soul introduced me to a curious enhancement to the porcelain throne at first i was skeptical of the device however how could i resist trying it when the throne room contained devilishly entertaining marketing material ever since reading it i cant think this too shall pass without picturing charming drawings of excrement

but if that were my only complaint i would not have the energy to write this letter the real trouble began in 2024 when i revisited redacted and rediscovered the joys of water jets upon my return to redacted i made the mistake of mentioning those joys to the other residents of redacted who unwisely conspired to equip our humble chamber pot with the french luxury

this decision which they intended as a birthday gift has placed shackles upon me you see when i visit public toiletsand i think we both know that i do that far far too much for a man of my youthi find myself unconsciously reaching for a dial that isnt there and looking at the toilet paper with disdain

if this unpleasant feeling only came during the rare times i ventured outward to shop or socialize i could avoid it by remaining within my domicile but i now find it manifesting even at work a place i visit every weekday

sometimes mr redacted ignorance truly is bliss on reddit people often say they wish they could remove some of their memories so they could watch their favorite show or play their favorite video game for the first time once i shared that desire but now i wish i could go back to the days when i had standards suitable for my station and only expected tush hygiene to involve toilet paper of varying quality

his fucklust taking hold growling as his grip on my hips tightens manhandling me forcing my head into the pillow to muffle my screams as he pulls out of my cunt and chooses to enter stretch fill and gape my tight little ass the way his growls intensify as he visibly enjoys my pain and gets off on the way the tightness of my ass grips his thick cock each time i struggle scream and try to break free of his vice like grip

my screams completely muffled by the way he jams my head into the pillow smothering me as my ability to inhale is taken from me making sound impossible and breathing just as hard if others would hear those screams they would hear my outward pleas to him to stop hurting me if they saw inside my head however they would see a needy little owned slut who wants him to use me fuck me stretch me hurt me

hurt me more please and fill me with that all consuming violence that creates fear driven lust within me that only you using me this way can bring to my being and my existence",NaughtySketchArt,worldpolitics,1,12,https://i.redd.it/tt1iscalhk5e1.jpeg
